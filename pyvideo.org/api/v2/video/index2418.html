However, a more robust serialization package would drastically improve the situation. To leverage the cores found in modern processors we need to communicate functions between different processes -- and that means callables must be serialized without pickle barfing.  Similarly, parallel and distributed computing with MPI, GPUs, sockets, and across other process boundaries all need serialized functions (or other callables).  So why is pickling in python so broken?  Python's ability to leverage these awesome communication technologies is limited by python's own inability to be a fully serializable language.  In actuality, serialization in python is quite limited, and for really no good reason.\r\n\r\nMany raise security concerns for full object serialization, however it can be argued that it is not pickle's responsibility to do proper authentication. In fact, one could apply rather insecure serialization of all objects the objects were all sent across RSA-encrypted ssh-tunnels, for example. \r\n\r\nDill is a serialization package that strives to serialize all of python.  We have forked python's multiprocessing to use dill. Dill can also be leveraged by mpi4py, ipython, and other parallel or distributed python packages. Dill serves as the backbone for a distributed parallel computing framework that is being used to design the next generation of large-scale heterogeneous computing platforms, and has been leveraged in large-scale calculations of risk and uncertainty.  Dill has been used to enable state persistence and recovery, global caching, and the coordination of distributed parallel calculations across a network of the world's largest computers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[http://pythonhosted.org/dill](http://pythonhosted.org/dill \"\")\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/uqfoundation](https://github.com/uqfoundation \"\")\r\n\r\n[http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2013/12/05/Parallelism-and-Serialization/](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2013/12/05/Parallelism-and-Serialization/ \"\")\r\n\r\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19984152/what-can-multiprocessing-and-dill-do-together?rq=1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19984152/what-can-multiprocessing-and-dill-do-together?rq=1 \"\")\r\n\r\n[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mpi4py/1fd4FwdgpWY](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mpi4py/1fd4FwdgpWY \"\")\r\n\r\n[http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/anonymous/5241793](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/anonymous/5241793 \"\")", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/oSoT0m8SgrU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/oSoT0m8SgrU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/oSoT0m8SgrU/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSoT0m8SgrU", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-09", "added": "2014-07-09T19:24:51.603", "updated": "2014-07-09T19:24:51.603"}, {"category": "SciPy 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "the-wonderful-world-of-scientific-computing-with", "speakers": ["David P.

Many big data frameworks such as Hadoop now support Python to some extent. PySociaLite is a new big data framework developed at Stanford. It is designed from beginning to be fully integrated into Python. In PySociaLite, SQL-like queries (called SociaLite) are directly embedded within Python code; the queries can access Python variables and functions, so there is full inter-operation between SociaLite and Python.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will give a brief overview of SociaLite, then mainly present the techniques for the integration of SociaLite into Python. SociaLite builds on top of well-known programming concepts -- tables and relational operations -- and it allows users to declare distributed tables to perform, for example, distributed join operations. For the integration of SociaLite into Python, we basically extend Jython interpreter to process embedded SociaLite queries. More specificaly, we use PyParsing to recognize SociaLite queries and re-write the queries into Java function calls. We also use lesser-known Python features, such as import hooks to process SociaLite queries within imported modules. To access Python functions within SociaLite, Jython interpreter instance (from which SociaLite queries are executed) is passed to SociaLite runtime system, and used to lookup and access Python functions. For the distributed execution, Python functions are serialized (as well as its PyCode object) and copied to cluster machines. \r\n\r\nTime permitting, I will give a demo of PySociaLite; SociaLite queries will be executed interactively within (extended) Jython shell and demonstrate the inter-operation between SociaLite and Python.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\nJiwon Seo is a PhD student in Stanford university, studying parallel query language for data analysis. He contributed to Python in various ways; for example, he implemented PEP 289 (Generator Expressions) and PEP 3102 (Keyword-Only Arguments).\r\n\r\nHe designed and implemented a parallel and distributed query language, called SociaLite. The SociaLite compiler generates efficient parallel/distributed code from user queries. SociaLite queries can be embedded in Python programs, allowing users to enjoy flexibility of Python and efficiency of SociaLite.

Things get worse when it comes to writing a spaghetti code in both short time and high performance, which is often the case doing data analysis.\r\n\r\nIn fact, cases like computation under different conditions, programs can be easily parallelized (distributed) with a few modifications using existed library like multiprocessing, IPython Parallel, and Celery.\r\n\r\nThis talk makes you not afraid of parallel or distributed computing and provides ways for different level of parallelization from single machine, cluster, to cluster with task queue. I will only talk about the basic scenario, which should be easier for newbies to try on and understand how powerful these tools can be.\r\n\r\nA machine learning example will be given in the end to compare performance and possible issues with different implementations. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\n\u5446\u5446\u96fb\u96de\u751f\uff0c\u559c\u6b61\u5beb R / Python\uff0c\u559c\u6b61\u7d71\u8a08\u8207\u751f\u7269\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u70ba Taiwan R Users Group \u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u54e1\u53ca Taipei.py \u5e38\u5ba2\u3002\r\n\r\nBioinfo / Stat / R / Python, master student of NTU BEBI.
