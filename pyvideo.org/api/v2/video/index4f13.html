This presentation discusses how scientific computing is incorporated into the curriculum, and why Fortran and Python were chosen as the languages to be taught.", "description": "Scientific computing is integrated into the undergraduate meteorology curriculum at Millersville University.  The curriculum guidelines published by the American Meteorological Society specifically address scientific computing in undergraduate atmospheric sciences curricula, stating that students should gain \u201cexperience using a high-level structured programming language (e.g., C, C++, Python, MATLAB,  IDL, or Fortran).\u201d   This is addressed at Millersville via the programming-specific courses are ESCI 282 \u2013 _Fortran Programming for the Earth Sciences_, and ESCI 386 \u2013 _Scientific Programming, Analysis and Visualization with Python_.  There are also additional courses in which the students are required to use scientific computing as part of their assignments.  Examples of these courses are ESCI 445 \u2013 _Numerical Modeling of the Atmosphere and Oceans_, and ESCI 390 \u2013 _Remote Sensing_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the university\u2019s computer science department teaches programming courses in Java, this is not very applicable to our students\u2019 needs for scientific programming.  We therefore teach our own programming courses in-house.  The required programming course taken by all students is the Fortran course, which teaches them the elements of programming.  This is many students\u2019 first exposure to programming.  Most then follow-on by taking the Python course.  In the Python course, scientific data analysis and visualization are stressed, using the Scientific Python, Numerical Python, and Matplotlib libraries.\r\n\r\nIn the elective numerical modeling course, students are required to write programs for finite-difference solutions to various 1-D and 2-D partial differential equations relevant to modeling the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere.  They may program in any language of their choosing, but the majority of students choose Python, even if they have no prior experience with it.  This is because of Python\u2019s  intuitive syntax and ease of use.  In the elective remote sensing course students are introduced to and use IDL/ENVI for display and analysis of remote sensing imagery.\r\n\r\nPrior to 2012 the current Python course was instead taught as a course in IDL.  The transition was made for several reasons.  The primary reason was the limited market and usage of IDL compared to more pervasive languages such as MATLAB and Python.  Many students would not have access to IDL once they graduate.  Also, Python is gaining traction in usage in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences, and is not proprietary like IDL and MATLAB, so students will have access to it no matter where they find employment or graduate school opportunities.  The high cost of maintaining an institutional IDL license is also an issue that the university must address annually, and it times of lean budgets it becomes an attractive target for elimination.  The IDL course is still on the books, but there are no immediate plans for upcoming offerings.\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/igBEH7H8Ahk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/igBEH7H8Ahk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/igBEH7H8Ahk/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igBEH7H8Ahk", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-09", "added": "2014-07-09T19:24:53.705", "updated": "2014-07-09T19:24:53.705"}, {"category": "SciPy 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "socialite-python-intergrated-query-language-for", "speakers": ["Jiwon Seo"], "tags": ["bioinformatics", "blast", "data analysis"], "related_urls": [], "id": 2729, "state": 1, "title": "SociaLite: Python intergrated query Language for Data Analysis", "summary": "SociaLite is a Python-integrated query language for data analysis.

The performance of SociaLite is often more than three orders of magnitude faster than Hadoop programs, and close to optimized C programs.  For example, PageRank algorithm can be implemented in just 2 lines of SociaLite query, which runs nearly as fast as an optimal parallelized C code. \r\n\r\nSociaLite supports well-known high-level concepts to make data analysis easy for non-expert programmers.\r\nWe support relational tables for storing data, and relational operations, such as join, selection, and projection, for processing the data. Moreover, SociaLite queries are fully integrated with Python, so both SociaLite and Python code can be used to implement data analysis logic.  For the integration with Python, we support embedding and extending SociaLite, where embedding supports using SociaLite queries directly in Python code, and extending supports using Python functions in SociaLite queries. \r\n\r\nThe Python integration makes it easy to implement various analysis algorithms in SociaLite and Python. For example, the BLAST algorithm in bioinformatics can be implemented in just a few lines of SociaLite queries and Python code. Also genome assembly algorithm -- generating a De Bruijn graph and applying Eulerian cycle algorithm -- can be simply implemented. In the talk, I will demonstrate these algorithms in SociaLite as well as more general algorithms such as K-means clustering and logistic regression.\r\n\r\nThe SociaLite queries are compiled to highly optimized parallel/distributed code; we apply optimizations such as pipelined evaluation and prioritization. The runtime system also speeds up the performance; for example, the customized memory allocator reduces memory allocation time and footprint.

Coordination between the algorithmic and domain programmer is \r\nchallenging to do well and difficult to scale.  It is also arguably one of the\r\nmost relevant blocks to scientific progress today.\r\n\r\nThis talk draws from experience supporting mathematical programmers in the\r\nSymPy project.  SymPy is a computer algebra system, a complex problem that\r\nrequires the graph manipulation algorithms of a modern compiler alongside the           mathematics of several PhD theses.  SymPy draws from a broad developer base\r\nwith experienced and novice developers alike and so struggles to maintain a\r\ncohesive organized codebase.\r\n\r\nWe approach this development problem by separating software engineering\r\ninto a collection of small functions, written by domain experts, alongside an\r\nabstract control system, written by algorithmic programmers.  We facilitate\r\nthis division with techniques taken from other languages and compiler \r\ntechnologies.  Notably we motivate the use of a few general purpose libraries\r\nfor multiple dispatch, pattern matching, and programmatic control.\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/QldxygVVj-s?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/QldxygVVj-s?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/QldxygVVj-s/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QldxygVVj-s", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-09", "added": "2014-07-09T19:24:48.358", "updated": "2014-07-09T19:24:48.358"}, {"category": "SciPy 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "teaching-numerical-methods-with-ipython-notebooks", "speakers": ["Aron Ahmadia", "David I.
