A flexible software framework has been developed using Python to acquire, analyze, and finally visualize data from multiple sensors, including novel gamma ray imaging detectors and a Microsoft Kinect.", "description": "**Introduction and Motivation**\r\n\r\nGamma-rays are photons with energies typically thousands to millions of\r\ntimes greater than the energy of visible light photons. The vastly higher\r\nenergies of gamma-rays means that they interact differently with matter,\r\nnecessitating new sensors and imaging methods to localize gamma ray sources.\r\nMany sensors and imaging approaches have been developed to image gamma-rays\r\nin 2D, as in a conventional camera, with applications in astronomy, medical\r\nimaging, and nuclear security.  We have developed a mobile gamma-ray imaging\r\nsystem that merges data from both visual and gamma-ray imaging sensors to\r\ngenerate a visualization of the 3D gamma-ray distribution in real-time. This\r\ncreates 3D maps of the physical environment and correlates that with the\r\nobjects emitting gamma-rays. We have used Python to develop a flexible\r\nsoftware framework for acquiring data from the multiple sensors, analyzing\r\nand merging data streams, and finally visualizing the resulting 3D gamma-ray\r\nmaps. \r\n\r\n**Methods**\r\n\r\nThe system consists of a cart that contains a state-of-the art gamma-ray\r\nimaging system, called a Compton Imager, coupled with an RGB-D imaging\r\nsystem, a Microsoft Kinect. The software package has three main tasks:\r\ngamma-ray acquisition and processing, visual data processing, and finally\r\nthe merger of these two streams. The gamma-ray data processing pipeline\r\ninvolves many computationally intensive tasks, thus a threaded structure\r\nbuilt with multiprocessing forms the basis of the gamma-ray imaging\r\nframework. Furthermore, many other Pythonic tools have been used to meet our\r\nreal-time goal; including numexpr, cython, and even the Python/C API.\r\nSeveral GUI frontends, built with TraitsUI or PySide for example, are used\r\nto monitor and control how the acquired data is processed in real-time,\r\nwhile a suite of real-time diagnostics are displayed with matplotlib. The\r\nvisual pipeline is based on an open-source implementation of RGBDSLAM\r\n(http://wiki.ros.org/rgbdslam), which is built on the Robot Operating System\r\n(ROS) framework. Finally, these two data streams are sent to a laptop\r\ncomputer via pyzmq, where the final merger and imaging (by solving a\r\nstatistical inversion problem constrained by the visual data) is\r\naccomplished. The results are then displayed as they are produced by the\r\nimaging algorithm using mayavi.\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\nLink to Video: [Moving Cart 3D scene](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1w5yrqwepjcbpt1/Moving%20Cart%203D%20scene.mov)\r\n\r\nThis system has been used to demonstrate real-time volumetric gamma ray\r\nimaging for the first time [1]. The results from a typical run are shown in\r\nthe above video. The red line indicates the movement of the system through\r\nthe environment, while the blue arrows represent an aspect of the gamma-ray\r\ndata. The 3D point-cloud provided by RGBDSLAM appear incrementally as the\r\nsystem traverses the environment. In the end, the location of a small\r\ngamma-ray emitting source is correctly identified with the hotspot in the\r\nimage.\r\n\r\n[1] [https://www.nss-mic.org/2013/ConferenceRecord/Details.asp?PID=N25-4]\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/I_YpsekEhhg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/I_YpsekEhhg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/I_YpsekEhhg/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YpsekEhhg", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-13", "added": "2014-07-15T22:45:41.376", "updated": "2014-07-16T11:43:07.046"}, {"category": "SciPy 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "a-success-story-in-using-python-in-a-graduate-che", "speakers": ["John Kitchin"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [], "id": 2800, "state": 1, "title": "A Success Story in Using Python in a Graduate Chemical Engineering Course", "summary": "I recently used Python in a new required graduate level chemical reaction engineering core course.

Last year, I taught the first course in the\r\ndepartment using Python. In this talk I will present how I did that, and why\r\nit was possible. The first step was demonstrating that Python + numpy +\r\nscipy + matplotlib can solve all the problems we used to solve with Matlab.\r\nThis was documented in a project called PYCSE through a series of over one\r\nhundred blog posts and organized in a web site ([1][]). Second, the\r\ndevelopment of Python distributions such as Enthought Canopy made it\r\npossible to students to easily install and use Python. I had to augment this\r\nwith some additional functionality with PYCSE ([2][]) which adds some\r\nstatistical analysis, differential equation solvers, numerical\r\ndifferentiation functions and a publish function to convert Python scripts\r\nto PDF files with captured output for grading. The only feature of Python\r\nmissing is a robust units package; several partial solutions exist, but none\r\nsolve all the needs of engineering calculations. Third, Emacs + org-mode\r\nenabled me to write the course notes with integrated Python code and output.\r\nThese notes were provided to the students in PDF form, and annotated during\r\nlecture using a tablet PC. Finally, the course was administered with box.com\r\nand a custom python module to automate assignment collection and return\r\n([3][]). An integrated grade widget in the PDF files that was created when\r\nthe students published their assignments was used to aggregate the grades\r\nfor the gradebook. I used an innovative homework schedule of one problem\r\nevery 2-4 days with rapid feedback to keep students using Python frequently.\r\nWe used timed quizzes and online exams to assess their learning. Overall,\r\nthe course was successful. Student evaluations of the course were as good as\r\ncourses that used other software packages.

A spatial weight $w_{i,j}$ represents potential interaction between each $i,j$ pair in a set of $n$ spatial units.  The weights are generally defined as either binary $w_{i,j}=\\\\{1,0\\\\}$, depending on whether or not $i$ and $j$ are considered neighbors, or a continuous value reflecting some general distance relationship between $i$ and $j$.  This work focuses on the case of binary weights using a contiguity criteria where $i$ and $j$ are rook neighbors when sharing an edge and queen neighbors when sharing a vertex.\r\n\r\nPopulation of the $W$ is computationally expensive, requiring, in the naive case, $O(n^2)$ point or edge comparisons.  To improve efficiency data decomposition techniques, in the form of regular grids and quad-trees, as well as spatial indexing techniques using r-trees have be utilized to reduce the total number of local point or edge comparisons.  Unfortunately, these algorithms still scale quadratically.  Recent research has also shown that even with the application of parallel processing techniques, the gridded decomposition method does not scale as $n$ increases.  \r\n\r\nThis work presents the development and testing of a high performance [implementation](https://github.com/jlaura/pysal/blob/weights/pysal/weights/_contW_binning.py#L181), written in pure Python, using time constant and $O(n)$ operations, by leveraging high performance containers and a vertex comparison method.  The figures below depict results of initial testing using synthetically generated lattices of triangles, squares, and hexagons with rook contiguity in black and queen contiguity in gray.  These geometries were selected to control for average neighbour cardinality and average vertex count per geometry.  From these initial tests, we report a significant speedup over r-tree implementations and a more modest speedup over gridded decomposition methods.  In addition to scaling linearly, while existing methods scale quadratically, this method is also more memory efficient.  Ongoing work is focusing on testing using randomly distributed data, and U.S. Census data, the application of parallelization techniques to test further performance improvements, and the use of fuzzy operator to account for spatial error .\r\n\r\n![raw times](http://github.com/pysal/pPysal/blob/master/weights/figures/rawtime.png?raw=true \\\"Initial Results - Raw Speed\\\")\r\n\r\n![speedup](http://github.com/pysal/pPysal/blob/master/weights/figures/speedup.png?raw=true \\\"Initial Results - Speedup\\\")\r\n\r\n![linear speed](http://github.com/pysal/pPysal/blob/master/weights/figures/rawl.png?raw=true \\\"Initial Results - List Raw Speed\\\")\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/kNcA-yE_iNI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/kNcA-yE_iNI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/kNcA-yE_iNI/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNcA-yE_iNI", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-13", "added": "2014-07-15T22:45:40.244", "updated": "2014-07-16T13:59:01.407"}, {"category": "SciPy 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "geopandas-geospatial-data-pandas", "speakers": ["Kelsey Jordahl"], "tags": ["gis"], "related_urls": [], "id": 2790, "state": 1, "title": "GeoPandas: Geospatial Data + Pandas", "summary": "GeoPandas extends the pandas data analysis library to work with geographic objects.", "description": "[GeoPandas](https://github.com/kjordahl/geopandas) is a library built on top of pandas to extend its capabilities to allow spatial calculations.

However, any prediction arising from a computer model must be rigorously tested to ensure its reliability. Verification is a process that ensures that the outputs of a computation accurately reflect the solution of the mathematical models. \r\n\r\nThis talk will first provide an introduction to the method of manufactured solutions (MMS), which is a powerful approach for verification of model problems in which a solution cannot be determined analytically. However, verifying computational science software using manufactured\r\n\r\nsolutions requires the generation of the solutions with associated forcing terms and their reliable implementation in software. There are several issues that arise in generating solutions, including ensuring that they are meaningful, and the algebraic complexity of the forcing terms. After briefly discussing these issues, the talk will introduce MASA, the Manufactured Analytical Solution Abstraction library. MASA is an open-source library written in C++ (with python interfaces) which is designed for the veri?cation of software used for solving a large class of problems stemming from numerical methods in applied mathematics including nonlinear equations, systems of algebraic equations, and ordinary and partial differential equations.\r\n\r\nExample formulations in MASA include the Heat Equation, Laplace's Equation, and the Navier-Stokes Equations, but in principle MASA supports instantiating any model that can be written down mathematically. This talk will end with details on two methods to import manufactured solutions into the library, either by generate the source terms, or using the automatic differentiation capabilities provided in MASA.\r\n\r\nThe library is available at: [https://github.com/manufactured-solutions/MASA](https://github.com/manufactured-solutions/MASA)\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/OvyqO4fxdKs?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/OvyqO4fxdKs?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/OvyqO4fxdKs/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyqO4fxdKs", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-13", "added": "2014-07-15T22:45:40.581", "updated": "2014-07-16T14:10:49.446"}, {"category": "SciPy 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "measuring-rainshafts-bringing-python-to-bear-on", "speakers": ["Scott Collis"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [], "id": 2788, "state": 1, "title": "Measuring Rainshafts: Bringing Python to Bear on Remote Sensing Data", "summary": "This presentation details how Python is being used to extract geophysical insight from active remote sensing data, namely Radars.

After Fourier transform, linear equations are set up to compute a prediction filter in the FX domain.  These equations are created using data slicing,  conjugate transpose, matrix multiple (all available in numpy).  Scipy.linalg.solve is used to solve for the prediction error filter.  A final filter is computed using the recursive filter capability in scipy.signal.lfilter.
