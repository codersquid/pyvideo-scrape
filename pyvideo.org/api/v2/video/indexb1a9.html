The truth is that there are still large groups of people who have either limited or no web access. In addition, there are people who have excellent web access, yet still prefer to use simpler tools to connect to others. How can we reach these groups of people? While not perfectly ubiquitous, SMS technology is much more widespread, especially in areas that don't have great internet connectivity. It's also ubiquitous in the sense that people who have excellent internet access still use SMS frequently.\nThe government of Libya recently implemented a voter registration system and chose to use SMS as the implementation technology, largely because of these reasons. In this talk, I will explain how we used RapidSMS, a Django-based SMS framework, to build this groundbreaking voter registration system. We will discuss the basics of the RapidSMS framework, and show concrete examples from our Libyan project. I will mostly describe concepts at a high level, though familiarity with Python code may help you understand the details.\nIf you truly want your tools to reach everyone, adding SMS connectivity will spread the power of your web apps.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-reaching-beyond-the-web/pyconza2014-reaching-beyond-the-web.thumbs/14%20A%20Reaching%20Beyond%20the%20Web-_000450.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-reaching-beyond-the-web/14%20A%20Reaching%20Beyond%20the%20Web-.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-reaching-beyond-the-web/14%20A%20Reaching%20Beyond%20the%20Web-.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://archive.org/details/pyconza2014-reaching-beyond-the-web", "whiteboard": "ia scrape", "recorded": "2014-10-03", "added": "2015-08-22T21:43:30.143", "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:30.143"}, {"category": "PyCon ZA 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "what-i-learned-about-python-and-about-guidos-t", "speakers": ["David Mertz"], "tags": ["pyconza", "pyconza2014"], "related_urls": [], "id": 3840, "state": 1, "title": "What I learned about Python \u2013 and about Guido's time machine \u2013 by reading the python-ideas mailing list", "summary": "One of the ways that changes enter the Python language is via their prior discussion on the python-ideas mailing list.

Not always, of course, but often.\nA wonderful case study of this process is the innocuous seeming built-in 'sum()'. This function has an intricate history, with a great deal of dispute over just what its semantics and performance characteristics can or should be. A particular thread on python-ideas, rich with discussions of use cases and subtle semantics, led both to the creation of the 'statistics' module in Python 3.4 (which contains a \"private\" version of the function, 'statistics._sum()') and to a rejection of performance \"optimizations\" when operating over collections of collections (which may or may not seem obvious to \"sum\" in the first place).", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-ideas/pyconza2014-python-ideas.thumbs/8%20What%20I%20learned%20about%20Python-_000690.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-ideas/8%20What%20I%20learned%20about%20Python-.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-ideas/8%20What%20I%20learned%20about%20Python-.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://archive.org/details/pyconza2014-python-ideas", "whiteboard": "ia scrape", "recorded": "2014-10-03", "added": "2015-08-22T21:43:28.466", "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:28.466"}, {"category": "PyCon ZA 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "building-the-internet-of-things-with-raspberry-pi", "speakers": ["Neil Broers"], "tags": ["pyconza", "pyconza2014"], "related_urls": [], "id": 3844, "state": 1, "title": "Building the Internet of Things with Raspberry Pi", "summary": "With the advent of the low cost Raspberry Pi computer, anyone with a soldering iron and some basic Python skills can take everyday objects and transform them into fully networked, smart devices.\nIn this talk, I will show you how I hacked a Raspberry Pi into my home alarm system, turning my network of IP cameras into motion triggered sensors.

It is time for web frameworks to evolve and become more like graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks: these provide abstractions called \"windows\" or \"widgets\" that let a programmer write an application using terms that describe what is being built, with less (if any) focus on the underlying technologies needed to accomplish drawing these items on a screen.\nA web application programmer (in contrast to a GUI programmer) needs to know quite a few different technologies and a fair bit of effort is required to orchestrate these tools into achieving an end result: a template language, HTML, HTTP, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Reusing something substantial is especially difficult, which means in a sizeable web application the same dragons need to be fought several times over. If a programmer has to constantly deal with all this subject matter, it takes focus away from what actually needs to be built: the application itself.\nWhy are we putting up with having to know HTML and similar low-level technologies? Is it an elephant in the room? Something we pretend not to see, yet we accept the burden of having to work around it?\nI will show you what it takes to build a web application; what repetitive tasks there are and what a programmer needs to be aware of.

By using the power of Python within Blender, we can easily automate so many things, and make long tedious tasks seem like child's play.\nIn this talk I wanted to share a few real world examples where I used Python to do something that would otherwise be impossible (Or just take too long!)\nAt first, we will take a quick look at the API, and how to get started. Here we will look at where you can find what you are looking for, and how it all comes together. This wont be too in-depth, but just enough to give you a taste. We will play with the console a bit and see how to wield the mighty sword that is Python.\nAnd then, we will look at some scripts. These are a few of the scripts that I wrote while I was working on some random things. This will cover some things such as: Adding new mesh objects, updating object coordinates, changing special properties (such as modifers), and setting keyframes all from the console.\nThis talk is for anyone interested in seeing just how to leverage the power of Python in Blender.
