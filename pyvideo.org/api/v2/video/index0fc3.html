Given the 30 minute time constraint,\r\nI may shorten or drop the two introductory parts in favour of the narrative and\r\ndemonstration of interesting new APIs and code examples in the final two\r\nparts. My experience of delivering a similar talk at PyconUK 2013 is that those\r\nare the parts that will most interest the audience and prompt most audience\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nHere are my proposed sections with rough time allocations and descriptions:\r\n\r\n## Introducing Twisted Names (0-5)\r\n\r\nTwisted includes a comprehensive set of DNS components, collectively\r\nknown as Twisted Names.\r\n\r\n-   <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedNames>\r\n\r\nI will begin the talk with a quick introduction to Twisted Names and its\r\ncapabilities, including one or two simple code examples.\r\n\r\n## Introducing My Project (0-5)\r\n\r\nWith generous funding from The NLnet Foundation I am adding EDNS(0) and DNSSEC\r\nclient support in Twisted Names, including full DNSSEC verification and DANE\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIn the talk I will quickly summarise the steps taken and lessons learned in\r\nsecuring that funding, and hope to encourage the audience to seek funding to\r\nsupport there own pet OSS projects.\r\n\r\n## What's New in Twisted Names / Project Progress Report (10)\r\n\r\nMy project plan is divided into the following broad milestones.\r\n\r\n1.  EDNS(0)\r\n\r\n    1.  OPT record\r\n\r\n    2.  Extended Message object with additional EDNS(0) items\r\n\r\n    3.  EDNS Client\r\n\r\n2.  RRSET handling\r\n\r\n    1.  Canonical Form and Order of Resource Records\r\n\r\n    2.  Receiving RRSETs\r\n\r\n3.  DNSSEC\r\n\r\n    1.  New DNSSEC Records and Lookup Methods\r\n\r\n    2.  Security-aware Non-validating Client\r\n\r\n    3.  Validating Client\r\n\r\n4.  DANE\r\n\r\n    1.  A twistd dns authoritative server capable of loading and serving TLSA\r\n        records.\r\n\r\n    2.  A Twisted web client Agent wrapper which performs TLSA lookup and\r\n        verification of a server certificate.\r\n\r\n    3.  A HostnameClientEndpoint which performs TLSA lookup and verification of a\r\n        server certificate.\r\n\r\n    4.  A command line tool for debugging TLSA records and for verifying a\r\n        certificate file against a domain name.\r\n\r\n    5.  A TLSA Record class for encoding and decoding TLSA bytes.\r\n\r\n    6.  A TLSA lookup method which accepts port, protocol and hostname and constructs\r\n        a suitable TLSA domain name.\r\n\r\nIn the talk I will quickly outline these goals, report on my progress so far,\r\nand show running code examples to demonstrate the new APIs.\r\n\r\n## Future Developments (5)\r\n\r\nThe aim of my project is to lay foundations that will eventually allow\r\nend-to-end DNSSEC verification in all the core Twisted networking components,\r\nincluding Twisted Conch (SSH), Mail (SMTP, POP3), Perspective Broker (RPC), Web\r\n(HTTP, XML-RPC, SOAP), Words (XMPP, IRC).\r\n\r\nAdditionally I hope that this foundation work will encourage the development of\r\nend-to-end DNSSEC verification in many of the Open Source and commercial\r\nprojects built on top of Twisted.\r\n\r\nI will end the talk by outlining these exciting possibilities, and demonstrate\r\nsome code examples that illustrate these possibilities.\r\n\r\n## Q & A (5-10)\r\n\r\nI'm determined to leave at least five minutes at the end for audience\r\nquestions. At PyconUK 2013 I was frustrated because I ran out of time and ended\r\nup answering questions outside the lecture theatre; questions which would have\r\nbeen interesting to the whole audience.\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/kuSXK4gNYqw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/kuSXK4gNYqw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/kuSXK4gNYqw/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuSXK4gNYqw", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-25", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:24.600", "updated": "2014-07-31T01:14:02.133"}, {"category": "EuroPython 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "using-asyncio-aka-tulip-for-home-automation", "speakers": ["Dougal Matthews"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [{"url": "https://github.com/d0ugal/home", "description": ""}], "id": 2942, "state": 1, "title": "Using asyncio (aka Tulip) for home automation", "summary": "This talk will cover the new asyncio library in Python 3.4 (also known as Tulip) and will use the area of home automation as a case study to explore its features.

While we often think of the poor\r\nas lacking primarily food and shelter, the UN definition highlights\r\ntheir isolation. They have the least access to society's knowledge and\r\nservices and the most difficulty making themselves and their needs\r\nheard in our democracies.\r\n\r\nWhile smart phones and an exploding ability to collect and process\r\ninformation are transforming our access to knowledge and the way we\r\norganize and participate in our societies, those living in poverty\r\nhave largely been left out. This has to change.\r\n\r\nBasic mobile phones present an opportunity to effect this change\r\n[3]. Only three countries in the world have fewer than 65 mobile\r\nphones per 100 people [4]. The majority of these phones are not\r\nAndroid or iPhones, but they do nevertheless provide a means of\r\ncommunication -- via voice calls, SMSes [6], USSD [7] and instant\r\nmessaging.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, 25 countries have less than 5% internet penetration\r\n[5].\r\n\r\nVumi [1] is an open source text messaging system designed to reach out\r\nto those in poverty on a massive scale via their mobile phones. It's\r\nwritten in Python using Twisted.\r\n\r\nVumi is already used to:\r\n\r\n  * provide Wikipedia access over USSD and SMS in Kenya [8].\r\n  * register a million voters in Libya [10].\r\n  * deliver health information to mothers in South Africa [9].\r\n  * prevent election violence in Kenya [11].\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover:\r\n\r\n  * a brief overview of mobile networking and cellphone use in Africa\r\n  * why we built Vumi\r\n  * the challenges of operating in unreliable environments\r\n  * an overview of Vumi's features and architecture\r\n  * how you can help!\r\n\r\nVumi features some cutting edge design choices:\r\n\r\n  * horizontally scalable Twisted processes communicating using RabbitMQ.\r\n  * declarative data models backed by Riak.\r\n  * sharing common data models between Django and Twisted.\r\n  * sandboxing hosted Javascript code from Python.\r\n\r\nOverview of challenges Vumi addresses:\r\n\r\n*Scalability*: Vumi needs to support both small scale applications (demos, pilot projects, applications tailored for a particular community) and large ones (things that everyone within a country might use). We address this using Twisted workers that exchange messages via RabbitMQ and store data in Riak. Having projects share RabbitMQ and Riak instances significantly reduces the overhead for small projects (e.g. its not cost effective to launch the recommended minimum of 5 Riak servers for a small project).\r\n\r\n*Barriers to entry*: Often the people with good ideas don't have access to one of many things needed to run a production system themselves, e.g. capital, time, stable infrastructure. We address this by providing a hosted Vumi instance that runs sandboxed Javascript applications. All the application author needs is their idea, the ability to write Javascript and upload it to our servers. The target audience here is African entrepreneurs at incubator spaces like iHub (Nairobi), kLab (Kigali), BongoHive (Lusaka) and JoziHub (Johannesburg).\r\n\r\n*Unreliable third-party systems*: It's one thing for parts of ones own system to go down, it's another for crucial third-party systems to go down. Vumi takes an SMTP-like approach to solving this and uses persistent queues so that messages can back up in the queue while third-party systems are down and be processed when they become available again. We also feedback information on whether third-party messaging systems have accepted or reject messages to the application that initiated them.\r\n\r\nVumi is developed by the Praekelt Foundation [2] (and individual contributors!).\r\n\r\n  [1]: <http://vumi.org/> \"Vumi\"\r\n  [2]: <http://praekeltfoundation.org/> \"Praekelt Foundation\"\r\n  [3]: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bXjgx4J0C4#t=20> \"Spotlight on Africa\"\r\n  [4]: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_mobile_phones_in_use>\r\n  [5]: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users>\r\n  [6]: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service>\r\n  [7]: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data\r\n  [8]: <http://blog.praekeltfoundation.org/post/65981723628/wikipedia-zero-over-text-with-praekelt-foundation>\r\n  [9]: <http://blog.praekeltfoundation.org/post/65042080515/mama-launches-healthy-family-nutrition-programme>\r\n  [10]: <http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/01/01/over-one-million-register-for-constitutional-elections-on-final-sms-registration-day/#axzz2sroHcg00>\r\n  [11]: <http://blog.praekeltfoundation.org/post/51210616848/the-texting-will-never-be-done-peace-messages-in-kenya>", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/Vjslvo8atfw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/Vjslvo8atfw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vjslvo8atfw/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjslvo8atfw", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-24", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:28.726", "updated": "2014-07-31T01:20:33.872"}, {"category": "EuroPython 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "elasticsearch-from-the-bottom-up", "speakers": ["Alex Brasetvik"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [], "id": 2970, "state": 1, "title": "Elasticsearch from the bottom up", "summary": "This talk will teach you about Elasticsearch and Lucene's architecture.\r\n\r\nThe key data structure in search is the powerful inverted index, which is actually simple to understand.

It is highly important when implementing search.\r\n\r\n## Building indexes\r\nThe way indexes are built must balance how compact an index is, how easily we can search in it, how fast we can index documents - and the time it takes for changes to be visible.\r\n\r\nLucene, and thus Elasticsearch, builds them in segments.\r\n\r\n## Index segments\r\nA Lucene index consists of index segments, i.e. immutable mini-indexes.\r\n\r\nA search on an index is done by doing the search on all segments and merging the results.\r\n\r\nSegments are immutable:\r\n\r\nThis enables important compression techniques.\r\nDeletes are not immediate, just a marker.\r\nSegments are occasionally merged to larger segments. Then documents are finally deleted.\r\nNew segments are made by buffering changes in memory, and written when flushing happens. Flushes are largely caused by refreshing every second, due to real time needs.\r\n\r\n## Caches\r\nCaches like filter- and field caches are managed per segment. They are essential for performance.\r\n\r\nImmutable segments make for simple reasoning about caches. New segments only cause partial cache invalidations.\r\n\r\n## Elasticsearch indexes\r\nMuch like a Lucene index is made up of many segments, an Elasticsearch index is made up of many Lucene indexes.\r\n\r\nTwo Elasticsearch indexes with 1 shard is essentially the same as one Elasticsearch index with 2 shards.\r\n\r\nSearch all shards and merge. Much like segments, but this time possibly across machines.\r\n\r\nShard / Index routing enables various partitioning strategies. Simpler than it sounds, so one important example:\r\n\r\nEssential for time based data, like logs: can efficiently skip searching entire indexes - and roll out old data by deleting the entire index.\r\n\r\n## Common pitfalls\r\nWe must design our indexing for how we search - not the searches for how things are indexed. Be careful with wildcards and regexes.\r\n\r\nSince segments are immutable, deleting documents is expensive while deleting an entire index is cheap.\r\n\r\nUpdating documents is essentially a delete and re-index. Heavy updating might cause problems.\r\n\r\nHave enough memory and then some. Elasticsearch is very reliant on its caches.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nWe've seen how index structures are used, and why proper text processing is essential for performant searches.\r\n\r\nAlso, you now know what index segments are, and how they affect both indexing and searching strategies.\r\n\r\n## Questions", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/PpX7J-G2PEo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/PpX7J-G2PEo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/PpX7J-G2PEo/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpX7J-G2PEo", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-24", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:27.350", "updated": "2014-07-31T01:21:08.033"}, {"category": "EuroPython 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "eve-rest-apis-for-humanstm", "speakers": ["Nicola Iarocci"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [], "id": 2979, "state": 1, "title": "Eve - REST APIs for Humans\u2122", "summary": "Powered by Flask, Redis, MongoDB and good intentions the [Eve REST API framework](http://python-eve.org) allows to effortlessly build and deploy highly customizable, fully featured RESTful Web Services.

When I took a course in python programming, I found myself so fascinated that it altered my entire career. I became a scientific software developer. It was long and hard work to get from the level of 'Hello world' to the world of software development. The talk will cover how to embrace a non-IT education as a strength, how and why to atomize programming tasks and the importance of doing side projects.\r\n\r\n### 1. Embrace your background\r\nHaving domain specific knowledge from a field other than IT helps you to communicate with the team, the users and the group leader. It prevents misunderstandings and helps to define features better. A key step you can take is systematically apply the precise domain specific language to the code e.g when naming objects, methods or functions. Another is to describe the underlying scientific process step by step as a Use Case and write it down in pseudocode.\r\n\r\n### 2. Atomisation\r\nHaving a set of building block in your software helps to define responsibilities clearly. Smaller parts are easier to test, release and change. Modular design makes the software more flexible and avoids the Blob and Lava Flow Anti-Patterns. When using object oriented programming a rule of thumb is that an object (in Python also a method) does only one thing. You can express this Single Responsibility Principle as a short sentence for each module. Another practical action is to introduce Design Patterns that help to decouple data and its internal representation. As a result, your software becomes more flexible.\r\n \r\n### 3. Participating in side projects\r\nLearning from others is a great opportunity to grow. Through side projects you gain a fresh perspective and learn about best practices in project management. You gain new ideas for improvement and become aware of difficulties in your own project. You can easily participate in a scientific project by adding a small feature, writing a test suite or provide a code review on a part of a program.\r\n\r\nSummarizing, in scientific software development using domain-specific knowledge, atomisation of software, and participation in side projects are three things that help to create high quality software and to continuously improve as a developer.\r\n\r\nThe talk will address challenges in areas where science differs from the business world. It will present general solution one might use for software developed in a scientific environment for research projects rather then discussing particular scientific packages. \r\n\r\n### Qualifications\r\nDuring my PhD I developed a software on 3D RNA modeling (www.genesilico.pl/moderna/) that resulted in 7 published articles.
