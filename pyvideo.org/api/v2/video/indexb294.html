Geometric algorithms then generate some fun geometry, and\nthese are compounded to produce successively more complex and interesting\nshapes.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe author's intent is to demonstrate that effective stylistic 3D graphics can\nbe achieved using surprisingly small amounts of code. This hopefully makes the\ntopic amenable to 3D beginners, while possibly suggesting some alternative\napproaches to those with 3D experience.\n\nTalk Outline\n\nThroughout, discussion of ideas and code dissection alternates with live\nanimated demos, at 60fps on very modest hardware.\n\n  1. Inspirations - Effective non-photo-realistic work in gaming, movies and the demo scene. (1m) \n  2. A convenient & Pythonic way to model 3D polyhedra, and some neat generators to convert these into OpenGL arrays at runtime. (7m) \n  3. Composition of polyhedra to create more complex shapes. (3m) \n  4. The resulting performance characteristics: What works well from Python, and what doesn't. (2m) \n  5. Koch tetrahedron & tetrix, aka Sierpinski tetrahedron. (1m) \n  6. Surprisingly effective 3D models created from small bitmaps. (1m) \n  7. Automatic generation of trees, mazes, complex spaces. (3m) \n  8. Algorithmic modification of existing shapes, such as bevels, geometric duals, and polyhedron stellation. (2m) \n  9. Shapes that morph: Rearranging vertices on the fly (5m) \n  10. Questions (5m) \n\nThe ideas demonstrated in the talk are written against OpenGL 2.1, but written\nin a 'mostly OpenGL 3' style, using vertex buffer objects or vertex arrays.\n\nThe demo code uses pyglet to create a window and handle GUI events, and uses\nPyOpenGL for the majority of OpenGL calls, since it provides a more friendly\nand Pythonic interface. In the performance-sensitive inner render loop,\nhowever, I use pyglet's slightly more bare-bones OpenGL bindings.\n\nHowever, the majority of the talk focuses on the manipulation of abstract data\nstructures to represent geometry, which is not affected by these or other\nOpenGL library choices.\n\nThis is a substantially improved version of the talk 'Flying High: Hobbyist\nOpenGL from Python', previously presented at EuroPython 2010.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011AlgorithmicGenerationOfOpenGLGeometry275-566.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 171117418, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/381_algorithmic-generation-of-opengl-geometry.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.940"}, {"category": "PyCon US 2011", "language": "English", "slug": "pycon-2011--an--biased--survey-of-the-python-web", "speakers": ["Mark Ramm"], "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2011", "web", "webframeworks"], "related_urls": [], "id": 434, "state": 1, "title": "An (biased) survey of the python web", "summary": "", "description": "An (biased) survey of the python web\n\nPresented by Mark Ramm\n\nI may be BDFL of one framework, but that's also why I pay attention to the\nwhole ecosystem.

That's fortunately less common when \"our\ncode\" is a library or framework;-), but, alas!, sadly widespread when \"our\ncode\" is an application or website -- that's why questions about screen-\nscraping the web and simulating keystrokes and mouse gestures need be so\ntragically frequent all over the web.\n\nOnce past the obvious hurdle of not having any API at all, there's still\nplenty of ways we can go badly wrong in the process of designing one -- and\nmany of those ways fall into recognizable categories, i.e., patterns.\nSpecifically, since they're frequently observed categories of defective\ndesign, they're anti-patterns -- and that's what this talk is in fact about\n(as the smartest among you could tell from the title...).\n\nI'm eminently qualified to present on this subject, since, in a lifetime spent\nmostly stumbling into software (after actually qualifying to design hardware\nin college, but only doing that for a few years), I've been responsible for\nmore of my shares of API design fumbles (plus, of course, just like every\nother programmer, I've done my share of swearing at the design fumbles of\nother API designers).

The goal is to give\nother people tips and pointers for applying these ideas themselves.\n\nAbstract\n\nContinuous deployment is the practice of putting the latest revision of\nsoftware into production use all the time, as opposed to working towards\nlarger releases. The important difference is iteration time: whereas large\nsoftware packages produce new software in timeframes of years or months,\ncontinuous deployment teams typically put new code into production in\ntimeframes of hours or less.\n\nThe practice is slowly attracting a small but growing group of loyal\nfollowers, just like continuous integration over the past few years and test-\ndriven development did before that. They can be explained in terms of being\nnatural extensions of each other. Like TDD and CI, CD gets eyed somewhat\nsuspiciously (and rightfully so: skeptical analysis is great), but the\nundersigned believes there's a legitimate advantage for many applications.\n\nMany years ago, TTD and testing tools in general were mostly ad-hockery. Now,\nwith many different production-quality testing tools, this has become\nunthinkable. Similarly, continuous integration was something other people did\nfor a long time, but now we have tools such as Buildbot and Hudson. Continuous\ndeployment is still somewhat in the early stage in terms of ready-to-use\ntools, but it's likely that we'll see a similar evolution.\n\nHere's a rough outline of what I plan to cover:\n\n  * a short history of people developed software \n  * from the recent models to CD (sort of a working definition of CD here) \n  * when is it a good idea? pros/cons \n  * requirements & battle plan for applying CD in an existing development environment (and possibly code base) \n  * an overview of existing tools and how they work together \n  * caveat emptors, known pitfalls (deployment and recovery strategies go here, since most implementations figure out they need them after stuff blows up) \n  * questions! (hopefully lots of people who've tried or are thinking about implementing something similar -- like I said, there are a lot of people implementing it but not too many ideas being bounced around) \n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011ContinuousDeployment817.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 134193408, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/407_continuous-deployment.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.952"}, {"category": "PyCon US 2011", "language": "English", "slug": "pycon-2011--couchdb-and-python-in-practice", "speakers": ["Luke Gotszling"], "tags": ["couchdb", "pycon", "pycon2011"], "related_urls": [], "id": 429, "state": 1, "title": "CouchDB and Python in practice", "summary": "", "description": "CouchDB and Python in practice\n\nPresented by Luke Gotszling\n\nThis talk introduces one 'NoSQL' solution, CouchDB, and how to get it to play\nwell with Python.

The zc.buildout (Buildout) package was developed to\nautomate this process.\n\nAs our use of buildout has matured, we've integrated it with system packaging\ntools and developed techniques for managing software deployemnt and service\nconfiguration. I'll provide a detailed description of the techniques and tools\nused.\n\nOutline:\n\n  * Buildout \n    * Motivation \n    * History \n    * Configuration files \n    * Recipes \n  * Deployment pholisophy: keeping software and service configuration separate \n  * System Packaging \n    * Making self-contained source releases (tar balls) \n    * Creating system packages from source releases with RPM \n  * Service configuration -- system build outs \n    * Scope: Python processes, cron, log rotation, run scripts, monitoring, etc. \n    * Place files in \"standard\" locations. \n    * Run by root \n    * examples \n  * Meta recipes \n    * Goal: provide only essential information. \n    * Recipes provide basic level of abstraction. \n    * Buildout provides basic tools to build on these abstractions, but these tools only scale so far. \n    * Buildout configuration language is *not* a programming language. \n    * Meta-recipes provide a much more powerful way to build high-level abstractions over basic recipes. \n  * Next step: Make me a ... \n    * Model based definition of complete systems spanning multiple hosts with interlocking services \n    * Automatic management of resources \n    * Implemented with ssh, system packaging tools (e.g. yum) and buildout-based tools. \n    * Four levels of abstraction \n    * Current status \n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011DeployingApplicationsWithZcbuildout710.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 155307917, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/426_deploying-applications-with-zc-buildout.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.956"}, {"category": "PyCon US 2011", "language": "English", "slug": "pycon-2011--disqus--serving-400-million-people-wi", "speakers": ["David Cramer", "Jason Yan"], "tags": ["casestudy", "disqus", "pycon", "pycon2011"], "related_urls": [], "id": 418, "state": 1, "title": "Disqus: Serving 400 million people with Python", "summary": "", "description": "Disqus: Serving 400 million people with Python\n\nPresented by David Cramer and Jason Yan\n\nDisqus, one of the largest Python applications on the web, will explain how\nthey deal with scaling complexities in a growing startup.
