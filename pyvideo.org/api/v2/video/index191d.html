What are the effects of diversity in the community, or lack thereof?\nI intend to approach this topic from an accessible and entertaining, yet\nanalytical perspective.\n\nAbstract\n\nLast year there was a photo of Kate Moss shown during a PyCon presentation\nwhich raised debate as to its appropriateness. This debate brought up some\ninteresting questions - but what I found most interesting was that while it\nelicited strong opinions, the issue seemed to be somewhat unexamined. This\nevent sparked a desire for deeper analysis on this topic in a more focussed\nsetting.\n\nIn this talk, I intend to address some of the core principles underlying this\ndebate. Discussion will include the following questions: Where does\nresponsibility lie in understanding these issues? What are the effects of\nfailing to do so? What are the effects of diversity in the community, or lack\nthereof? What do we lose by being more homogenous or more diverse? Gain?\n\nAs communities allow more diversity, they draw from a larger talent pool,\nchallenge each other more, and hit a higher bar in terms of ingenuity and\nwork-product.

The broader intent is to raise the\nlevel of understanding and community discourse on this topic.

Do you need to plan\nahead and build an application that will react to unanticipated needs? This\ntalk covers some techniques and pitfalls I encountered in writing my first\nreasonably large Django site, and what I did differently the second time I\nstarted a project.\n\nAbstract\n\nWhen working on a company product, especially one where developers don't\nalways have full control over the scope and needs of the application, it's\nimportant to plan ahead for unanticipated needs.\n\nThis talk will cover simple tricks and methods that are a small amount of work\nup front, but can save you lots of time later.\n\nPyCon Talk Outline\n\n  1. Introduction (5m) \n    * Me! \n  2. Making Mistakes \n    * It happens. \"Code quality can be measured by the number of WTFs per minute in the code review.\" \n    * When dealing with a big, expansive framework like Django, sometimes you just don't know that something is there. Good docs don't completely solve this...there's always going to be the thing you don't find. Similarly, sometimes you don't realize how to leverage something that you do know about until much later.  \n  \nMy regrets with my current project aren't sweeping architectural issues. I did\nmost of the big stuff right. My regrets are mostly small things that, because\nit was my first big project, there was this piece or that piece that I didn't\nsee or didn't fully appreciate, and so now I have little blocks of code that\nare tougher to maintain than they need to be. End of the world? No. Worth\nthinking through for next time? Yes.\n\n  3. Some trivial things (10m) \n    * Preface: Yeah, some of these are dumb. \n    * Beginning at the beginning: Project Setup \n      * I had sys.path pointing to the directory above the project root, like the tutorial does. I wish I hadn't done that. \n      * Need to run two instances on the same box that don't share the actual codebase (e.g. a staging server)? You still can, but it's more awkward. Better to set sys.path at your project root. \n    * Dude, where's my Media class? \n      * How did I do it? First I had a magic template variable. Then I copied Form.Media \n      * Then, on a later project, I realized a block works just fine. \n    * My boss wants ____ available on every page! \n      * How did I do it? I had a method we called everywhere that took arbitrary keyword arguments... \n      * Oh, there's TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS... \n        * ...if you manually use RequestContext every time! So, just do that. Always. Even if you don't need it. \n        * I want .select_related('something') every time! \n        * ...so I typed it! A lot. \n        * Oh, that can be done by overriding def queryset on the manager class? That's easier to maintain... \n          * ...but make sure you set the flag to use it on related fields! \n    * We need sample data for so-and-so, such-and-such... \n      * Disclaimer: This one actually isn't mine; my boss did it. But, it's amusing, and worth mentioning. \n      * We needed sample data so my boss could preview themes...so he set up a second database, put in fake data, and hard-coded it in the app-wide (not server-specific) settings.py. \n        * Copied the entire DB structure...at the time. But it changes. \n        * Oh, and the unit testing framework didn't appreciate it, either. \n      * Fixtures are the right way (and sooner or later I'll get this fixed...it's still there). \n        * (space reserved for my stumbling upon something else silly, and hopefully humorous, that I did wrong) \n          1. How to avoid missing trivial things? \n    * Read the documentation. Over and over. \n    * Become familiar with the Django code. \n  4. A non-trivial thing: Forms (10m) \n    * Django forms can do anything...given sufficient shenanigans. Always do it the Django forms way; your life will be easier. \n    * Forms and ModelForms are static, and I needed dynamic choices on a form... \n      * ...so I just ditched newforms \n      * But wait, this is Python. A trivial function that calls the metaclass can solve this problem! \n        * This looks complicated, but it's not. Walk through how to do it. \n        * It's quite maintainable, and you get all the other bells and whistles. \n  5. Questions?

This talk walks through how to use Genetic Algorithms and Genetic\nProgramming as tools to discover solutions to hard problems, when to use\nGA/GP, setting up the GA/GP environment, and interpreting the results. Using\n[pyevolve](http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/), we'll walk through a real-world\nimplementation creating a GP that predicts the weather.\n\nAbstract\n\nGenetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP) are methods used to\nsearch for and optimize solutions in large solution spaces. GA/GP use concepts\nborrowed from natural evolution, such as mutation, cross-over, selection,\npopulation, and fitness to generate solutions to problems. If done well, these\nsolutions will become better as the GA/GP runs.\n\nGA/GP has been used in problem domains as diverse as scheduling, database\nindex optimization, circuit board layout, mirror and lens design, game\nstrategies, and robotic walking and swimming. They can also be a lot of fun,\nand have been used to evolve aesthetically pleasing artwork, melodies, and\napproximating pictures or paintings using polygons.\n\nGA/GP is fun to play with because often-times an unexpected solution will be\ncreated that will give new insight or knowledge. It might also present a novel\nsolution to a problem, one that a human may never generate. Solutions may also\nbe inscrutable, and determining why a solution works is interesting in itself.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011GeneticProgrammingInPython350.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 223902641, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/428_genetic-programming-in-python.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.974"}, {"category": "PyCon US 2011", "language": "English", "slug": "pycon-2011--get-new-contributors--and-diversity--", "speakers": ["Asheesh Laroia"], "tags": ["diversity", "openhatch", "outreach", "pycon", "pycon2011"], "related_urls": [], "id": 415, "state": 1, "title": "Get new contributors (and diversity) through outreach", "summary": "", "description": "Get new contributors (and diversity) through outreach\n\nPresented by Asheesh Laroia\n\nGroups like the Fedora Design Team, Dreamwidth, SF Ruby, and OpenHatch have\ndiscovered the power of outreach to bring in new contributors.

Put simply,\nHookbox is a web-enabled message queue.\n\nBrowers may directly connect to Hookbox, subscribe to named channels, and\npublish and receive messages on those channels in real-time. An external\napplication (typically the web application itself) may also publish messages\nto channels by means of the Hookbox REST interface. All authentication and\nauthorization is performed by an external web application via designated\n\u201cwebhook\u201d callbacks.\n\nIn this talk we cover the broad principles of Hookbox, then examine a few\nshort examples in depth, including presenceful and moderated chat, real-time\ngraphing, and, of course, a game. The code examples are very purposefully\nbrief; the important parts of the talk deal with the interaction model between\nbrowser, web framework, and Hookbox -- everything else follows naturally and\neasily into place.\n\nThe audience need not be familiar with a particular web framework over\nanother, but they must be proficient with at least one.\n\nThough this talk is aimed at a novice level, we'll also spend some time\ntalking about the more advanced features that Hookbox provides.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011HookboxAllPythonWebframeworksNowRealtimeBatteri858.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 158119468, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/371_hookbox-all-python-web-frameworks-now-real-time-batteries-included.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.983"}, {"category": "PyCon US 2011", "language": "English", "slug": "pycon-2011--how-to-kill-a-patent-with-python", "speakers": ["Van Lindberg"], "tags": ["casestudy", "patents", "pycon", "pycon2011"], "related_urls": [], "id": 425, "state": 1, "title": "How to kill a patent with Python", "summary": "", "description": "How to kill a patent with Python\n\nPresented by Van Lindberg\n\nFinding the right piece of \"prior art\" - technical documentation that\ndescribed a patented piece of technology before the patent was filed - is like\nfinding a needle in a very big haystack. This session will talk about how I am\nmaking that process faster and more accurate through the use of natural\nlanguage processing, graph theory, machine learning, and lots of Python.\n\nAbstract\n\nFrom my work consulting on a number of patent cases, I am frequently asked to\nfind \"prior art\" - patents and publications that describe a technology before\na certain date. The problem is that the indexing mechanisms for patents and\npublications are not as good as they could be, making good prior art searching\nmore of an art than a science. When I decided to do better, I reached for\nPython.\n\n  * Part I (5 mins): The USPTO as a data source.* The full-text of each patent is available from the USPTO (and now from Google.) What does this data look like? How can it be harvested and normalized to create data structures that we can work with? \n  * Part II (15 mins, in two parts):* Once the patents have been cleaned and normalized, they can be turned into data structures that we can use to evaluate their relationship to other documents. This is done in two ways - by modeling each patent as a document vector and a graph node. \n  * Part IIA (7 mins): Patents as document vectors.* Once we have a patent as a data structure, we can treat the patent as a vector in an n-dimensional space. In moving from a document into a vector space, we will touch on normalization, stemming, TF/IDF, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). \n  * Part IIB (7 mins): Patents as technology graphs.* This will show building graph structures using the connections between patents - both the built-in connections in the patents themselves as well as the connections discovered while working with the patents as vectors. We apply some social network analysis to partition the patent graph and find other documents in the same technology space. \n  * Part III (5 mins): What have we built?* Now that we have done all this analysis, we can see some interesting things about the patent database as a whole. How does the patent database act as a map to the world of technology? And how has this helped with the original problem - finding better prior art?\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011HowToKillAPatentWithPython889.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 193772612, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/425_how-to-kill-a-patent-with-python.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.985"}]}
