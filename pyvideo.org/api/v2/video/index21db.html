Learning** is about *using the right features, to build the right \r\nmodels, to achieve the right tasks* [[Flach, 2012]][0]\r\nHowever, to come up with a definition of what actually means **right** for \r\nthe problem at the hand, it is required to analyse \r\nhuge amounts of data, and to evaluate the performance of different algorithms \r\non these data.\r\n\r\nHowever, deriving a working machine learning solution for a given problem \r\nis far from being a *waterfall* process. \r\nIt is an iterative process where continuous refinements are required for the \r\ndata to be used (i.e., the *right features*), and the algorithms to apply \r\n(i.e., the *right models*).\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, Python has been found very useful for practitioners and \r\nresearchers: its high-level nature, in combination with available tools and \r\nlibraries, allows to rapidly implement working machine learning code \r\nwithout *reinventing the wheel*.\r\n\r\n[**Scikit-learn**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is an actively \r\ndeveloping Python library, built on top of the solid `numpy` and `scipy` \r\npackages.\r\n\r\nScikit-learn (`sklearn`) is an *all-in-one* software solution, providing \r\nimplementations for several machine learning methods, along with datasets and \r\n(performance) evaluation algorithms.\r\n\r\nThese \"batteries\" included in the library, in combination with a nice and intuitive\r\nsoftware API, have made scikit-learn to become one of the most popular Python \r\npackage to write machine learning code.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, a general overview of scikit-learn will be presented, along with \r\nbrief explanations of the techniques provided out-of-the-box by the library.\r\n\r\nThese explanations will be supported by working code examples, and insights on \r\nalgorithms' implementations aimed at providing hints on \r\nhow to extend the library code.\r\n\r\nMoreover, advantages and limitations of the `sklearn` package will be discussed \r\naccording to other existing machine learning Python libraries\r\n(e.g., [`shogun`](http://shogun-toolbox.org \"Shogun Toolbox\"), \r\n[`pyML`](http://pyml.sourceforge.net \"PyML\"), \r\n[`mlpy`](http://mlpy.sourceforge.net \"MLPy\")).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, (examples of) applications of scikit-learn to big data and \r\ncomputational intensive tasks will be also presented.\r\n\r\nThe general outline of the talk is reported as follows (the order of the topics may vary):\r\n\r\n*   Intro to Machine Learning\r\n    *   Machine Learning in Python\r\n    *   Intro to Scikit-Learn\r\n*   Overview of Scikit-Learn\r\n    *   Comparison with other existing ML Python libraries\r\n*   Supervised Learning with `sklearn`\r\n    *   Text Classification with SVM and Kernel Methods\r\n*   Unsupervised Learning with `sklearn`\r\n    *   Partitional and Model-based Clustering (i.e., k-means and Mixture

math skills and a good knowledge of the Python language.\r\n\r\nGood knowledge of the `numpy` and `scipy` packages is also a plus.\r\n\r\n[0]: http://goo.gl/BnhoHa \"Machine Learning: The Art and

Machine Learning (ML) is the art of finding structure in data in an automated way and has given rise to a wide range of applications such as recommendation systems, object recognition, brain-computer interfaces, robotics, predicting stock prices, etc.\r\n\r\nOur toolbox offers extensive bindings with other software and computing languages, Python being the major target. The library was initiated in 1999 and remained under heavy development henceforth. In addition to its mature core-framework, Shogun offers state-of-the-art techniques based on latest ML research. This is partly made possible by the 21 Google Summer of Code projects (5+8+8 since 2011) that our students successfully completed. Shogun's codebase has >20k commits made by >100 contributors representing >500k lines of code. While its core is written in C++, a unique of technique for generating interfaces allows usage from a wide range of target languages -- under the same syntax. This includes in particular Python, but also Matlab/Octave, Java, C#, R, ruby, and more. We believe that users should be able to choose their favourite language rather than us dictating this choice. The same applies for supported OS (Linux, Mac, Win). Shogun is part of Debian Linux.\r\n\r\nFeatures of Shogun include most classical ML methods such as classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, etc, most of them in different flavours. All implemented algorithms in Shogun work on a modular data representation, which allows to easily switch between different sorts of objects as for example strings or matrices. Common ML-tasks and data IO can be carried under a unified interface. This is also true for the various external open-source libraries that are embedded within Shogun.\r\n\r\nCode examples are provided for all implemented algorithms. The main and most complete set of examples is in the Python language. In addition, in order to push usage of Shogun in education at universities, we recently started adding more illustrative IPython notebooks. A growing list of statically rendered versions are readily available from our [website](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook) and implement a cross-over of tutorial-style explanations, code, and visualization examples. We even took this up a notch and started building our own IPython-notebook server with Shogun installed in the cloud at (try cloud button in notebook view) . This allows users to try Shogun without installation via the IPython notebook web interface. All example notebooks can be loaded, interactively modified, and executed. In addition, using the Python Django framework, we built a collection of interactive web-demos where users can play around with basic ML algorithms, [demos](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/demo)\r\n\r\nIn the proposed talk, we will give a gentle and general introduction to ML and the core functionality of Shogun, with a focus on its Python interface. This includes solving basic ML tasks such as classification and regression and some of the more recent features, such as last year's GSoC projects and their IPython notebook writeups. ML material will be presented with a focus on intuition and visualisation and no previous familiarity with ML methods is required.\r\n\r\n## Key points in the talk\r\n\r\n * What are the goals in ML?\r\n * Example problems in ML (classification, regression, clustering)\r\n * Some basic algorithm ideas\r\n * Focus on Visualisation, not Maths\r\n\r\n## Intended Audience\r\n\r\n* All people dealing with data (data scientists, big-data hackers) who are looking for tools to deal with it\r\n * People with a general interest but no education in Machine Learning\r\n * People interested in the technology behind Shogun (swig, cloud notebook server, web-demos)\r\n * People from the ML community (scipy-stack)\r\n * ML scientists/Statisticians\r\n\r\n## Code examples\r\n\r\n * [Classification](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/python_modular/classifier_libsvm_modular.py)\r\n * [Clustering](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/em_2d_gmm.py)\r\n * [Source seperation](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/converter_jade_bss.py)\r\n * [IPython notebook examples](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook)\r\n\r\n### Slide examples\r\nSee our Europython 2010 [slides](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jvl4ra885usu4ii/WIoJccXA5r/talk.pdf).

As well as showing how a fairly large deployment works, we'll give tips on scaling and share a few insights that may help people running smaller sites discover how they can speed things up.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/ZRCjfSIVMNA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/ZRCjfSIVMNA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZRCjfSIVMNA/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRCjfSIVMNA", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-23", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:30.259", "updated": "2014-07-31T23:15:35.330"}, {"category": "EuroPython 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "automatic-code-reviews", "speakers": ["Carl Crowder"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [], "id": 2996, "state": 1, "title": "Automatic code reviews", "summary": "A lot of great Python tools exist to analyse and report on your codebase, but they can require a lot of  initial set up to be useful.

These tools usually require quite a lot of initial effort to get set up in a way which produces meaningful output for you or your organisation's particular coding style and values.

But time has come to use it as a means to accelerate applications that uses in-memory data too.\r\n\r\n[Blosc](http://www.blosc.org) is a high-performance meta-compressor that is meant to do that.", "description": "Compression is a technique to reduce the number of bits needed to\r\nrepresent a given dataset. A very common use-case in the distributed\r\ndigital age is to reduce the size of files in order to reduce the time\r\nand bandwidth requirements of sending a file from one location to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThere are a large variety of different algorithms and implementations of\r\nso called \"codecs\" - a term is derived from the fact that programs that\r\nimplement a compression algorithm commonly constitute of both a\r\ncompressor and a corresponding decompressor. There are many different\r\nspecial purpose compressors that exploit specifics in the structure of the\r\ninput data, for example: MP3, Ogg and FLAC for audio data such as music,\r\nGIF, JPEG and PNG for images and  MPEG for encoding video. Also, there\r\nare many general purpose codecs that make no assumptions about the\r\nstructure of the data, for example: Zlib(DEFLATE), Bzip2(BWT) and LZMA.\r\n\r\nHowever, and due to the ever growing divide between memory access latency and CPU clock\r\nspeed a new use-case beyond faster file transfers and more efficient use\r\nof disk-space has emerged: \"in-memory compression\".\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping data in RAM that is compressed also means that the CPU has to\r\ndo more work in order to make use of it.  However, if the compressor\r\nis fast enough, this decompression overhead could pay off, and\r\napplications could work with compressed data transparently, and so not\r\neven noticing the slowdown due to the extra effort for\r\ncompression/decompression.\r\n\r\nThis technique can be very beneficial in a variety of scenarios where\r\nRAM availability is critical.  For example, in-memory caching systems\r\nlike Memcached or Redis could store more data using the same resources\r\nthereby optimizing resource usage.  Another use case is to use\r\ncompression for in-memory data containers, \u00e0 la NumPy's ndarray or\r\nPandas' DataFrame, allowing for improved memory usage and potentially\r\nallow for accelerated computations.\r\n\r\nIn our talk, we will explain first why we are in a moment of computer\r\nhistory that [in-memory compression can be beneficial for modern\r\napplications] [1].\r\n\r\nThen, we will introduce [Blosc] [2], a high speed\r\nmeta-compressor, allowing other existing compressors (BloscLZ, LZ4,\r\nSnappy or even Zlib) to leverage the SIMD and multithreading framework\r\nthat it provides and help achieving extremely fast operation\r\n(frequently faster than a plain memcpy() system call).\r\n\r\nFinally, we will show some existing data handling libraries ([Bloscpack] [3], [PyTables] [4], [BLZ] [5]) -- all written in Python -- that\r\nalready use Blosc today for fulfilling the promise of faster operations by\r\ndoing in-memory compressing.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.pytables.org/docs/CISE-12-2-ScientificPro.pdf\r\n[2]: http://www.blosc.org\r\n[3]: https://github.com/Blosc/bloscpack\r\n[4]: http://www.pytables.org\r\n[5]: http://continuum.io/blog/blz-format", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/rilU44j_wUU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/rilU44j_wUU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/rilU44j_wUU/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rilU44j_wUU", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-23", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:30.854", "updated": "2014-07-31T23:19:07.339"}, {"category": "EuroPython 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "design-considerations-while-evaluating-developin", "speakers": ["Konark Modi"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [], "id": 3007, "state": 1, "title": "Design considerations while Evaluating, Developing, Deploying a distributed task processing system", "summary": "With the growing world of web, there are numerous use-cases which require tasks to be executed in an asynchronous manner and in a distributed fashion. \r\nCelery is one of the most robust, scalable, extendable and easy-to-implement frameworks available for distributed task processing.
