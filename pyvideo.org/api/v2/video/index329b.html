Further, the foundation maintains a wealth of open-source, open-access teaching materials for a several programming related topics, including Python, the Unix shell, Git, SQL, R and Matlab. \r\n\r\nLessons from Software Carpentry are usually delivered in the form of two day workshops. Taught by trained instructors, these workshops cover automation of repetitive tasks using the shell, building modular and testable programs using Python or R and using version control to build software in a collaborative and efficient manner. Furthermore, workshops may be expanded, covering topics such as SQL and the use of databases to reliably store and maintain data. Though of course it is impossible to train expert programmers in two days, Software Carpentry has had great success in teaching \u2018just enough\u2019 to researchers that they can then return to the lab with a strong foundation of skills to build from.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will focus on the major progress that has been made by Software Carpentry in Australia and worldwide since PyCon-Au 2014. In particular, the pool of Australian instructors has dramatically increased through the live training session held as part of the Research Bazaar conference held at Melbourne University in February. As such, the presentation will be somewhat meta \u2013 answering the question \u2018What are the educational principles and techniques you should know before attempting to teach novice programmers?\u2019 The Software Carpentry lesson content has also evolved in the last 12 months, with the lesson content expanding to such topics as the use of Pandas and the more effective use of the iPython Notebook to work with data and visualisation. These changes allow Software Carpentry to cater to a broader audience of researchers. There will also be some discussion of the Research Bazaar conference, which partnered with Software Carpentry this year to not only train instructors, but also run a series of other \u2018basic skills\u2019 workshops for researchers. Finally, there is an interesting sister organisation of Software Carpentry, known as Data Carpentry, which focuses on improving the way researchers work with and store their data. \r\n\r\n\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "embed": "<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/dGJzl286D5I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dGJzl286D5I/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGJzl286D5I", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2015-08-04", "added": "2015-10-18T16:10:57.564", "updated": "2015-10-18T16:10:57.564"}, {"category": "PyCon AU 2015", "language": "English", "slug": "spreadsheet-driven-meta-programming-for-python", "speakers": ["Javier Candeira"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [], "id": 3959, "state": 1, "title": "Spreadsheet-Driven Meta-Programming for Python", "summary": "", "description": "We've all had those very detail-oriented clients who are able to specify their needs very neatly, often by means of exhaustive spreadsheets.

Instead, it's a great chance to do something good for the community and get to know some fellow devs along the way. The sprints are an semi-formal two-day event following the close of the main track of the conference where people get together and code on whatever takes their fancy.

Standard workflows and tips on how and when to approach people for assistance can also help to make things flow more smoothly.\r\n\r\nIt will also include some tips for sprint leaders about how to make your project easy and enjoyable for others to hack on. There is a lot than can be done without a lot of effort, such as pre-classifying bugs or identifying appropriate tasks for newcomers, identifying \"go-to\" people in your project, and spending time on the day talking to people and getting them comfortable working on your code. Clearly documenting simple workflows (like how to submit a patch, what code standards are used, and how to validate results) can help tremendously.\r\n\r\nWith any luck, this presentation can help both sprint leaders and attendees with a smoother experience which gets the difficulties out the way and leaves maximum opportunity for coding and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nTennessee has gone through the meatgrinder of sprinting, from sitting down with a group of strangers trying to help them fix trivial bugs, to developing significant extensions, to leading sprints.

Test-driven development is a great way to make sure your software is up to specification before you start work. Even better, it makes sure your software\u2019s architecture is amenable to writing tests from day 1.\r\n\r\nSo what happens when you find yourself working on code where automated testing took a back seat to being shipped?

We\u2019ll look at techniques that I\u2019ve used to analyse faults in existing code, and how to translate those into tests, and how to use that to fix bugs.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we\u2019ll look at:\r\n\r\n- Tooling and metrics to help you decide what code to test, and how to measure progress when you\u2019re writing tests\r\n- Approaches to constructing test cases for old code, including using data-driven approaches, and approaches based on requirements specifications\r\n- Granularity \u2014 making tests on old code granular enough is difficult, so we\u2019ll look at the trade-offs between unit and integration tests on old code, and ways to make integration-level tests granular enough to make results reliable\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll see that testing old code is both achievable, and actually a worthwhile exercise.

In relation to content, Brendan will discuss the thought that went into targeting the material to a kids audience and the challenges involved in structuring a narrative which wends its way through each of the concepts that need to be introduced and providing a motivation for each of them. This includes how the content was structured, what concepts were included and what were passed over, trying to balance material to maintain interest without overwhelming the readers, the tension between explanation and demonstration and how to remain mindful of the audience's limitations.
