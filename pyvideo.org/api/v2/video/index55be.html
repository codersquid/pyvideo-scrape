Components are designed to process\nstreams of data modeled as a series of messages which are exchanged\nasynchronously. Data streams are initiated over an asynchronous REST\ninterface.\n\nAbstract\n\nThere's been some recent momentum around data flow programming with a number\nof new frameworks having been released. This new found interest is due largely\nin part to the increasing amount of data being produced and consumed by\napplications. MapReduce has become a general topic of discussion for analytics\nover large data sets but it's increasingly evident that it's not a panacea.\n\nSimple batch processing tools like MapReduce and Hadoop are just not powerful\nenough in any one of the dimensions of the big data space that really matters.\nOne particular area where MapReduce falls short is in near real-time search.\nIt used to be common to run batch processing jobs on a nightly basis which\nwould index the days events, making them searchable.\n\nGiven today's social dynamics, people have come to expect instant access to\ndata as opposed to a daily digest. Batch oriented semantics are being\nsuperseded by event driven architectures that act on live, real-time streams\nof data. This shift in paradigm has sparked new interest in dataflow concepts.\n\nDataflow frameworks promote the data to become the main concept behind any\nprogram. It becomes a matter of \"data-flow\" over \"control-flow\" where\nprocesses are just the way data is created, manipulated and destroyed. This\nconcept is well represented in the Unix operating system which pipes data\nbetween small single-purpose tools to produce more sophisticated applications.\n\nPypes is a dataflow framework that leverages Stackless Python to model\nprocesses as black box operations that communicate by sending and receiving\nmessages. These processes are naturally component oriented allowing them to be\nconnected in different ways to form new applications. Components are\ninherently stateless making parallel processing relatively simple. Because a\ncomponent is an abstraction of a Stackless tasklet (true coroutines),\nexpensive setups such as loading machine learning models are done once during\ninitialization and can then be used throughout the life of the component. This\nis in contrast to MapReduce frameworks that typically incur this overhead each\ntime the map function is called or try to manage some sort of global state.\n\nOne aspect that differentiates Pypes from other dataflow frameworks is its\n\"push\" model. Unlike generator based solutions which pull data through the\nsystem, Pypes provides a RESTful interface that allows data to be pushed in.\nThis allows Pypes to sit more natural as an event driven middleware component\nin the context of a larger architecture. A data push model also simplifies\nscalability since an entire cluster of nodes can be setup behind a load\nbalancer which will then automatically partition the incoming data stream.\nGenerator based \"pull models\" cannot easily partition data without somehow\ncoordinating access to the data which involves global state.\n\nPypes was designed to be a highly scalable, event driven, dataflow scheduling\nand execution environment. Writing your own components is simple and Pypes\nprovides Paste templates for creating new projects. Components are packaged as\nPython eggs and discovered automatically. They can be wired together using a\nvisual editor that runs in any HTML5 compliant browser. Pypes supports\nDirected Acyclic Graphs and data streams are modeled as a series of JSON\n(dict) packets which support meta-data at both the packet level and the field\nlevel.\n\nPypes also leverages the Python multiprocessing module to scale up. Data\narriving through the REST interface on any given node will be distributed\nacross parallel instances of the graph running on different cores/CPUs. Data\nsubmission is completely asynchronous.\n\nThis talk will provide a gentle introduction to the Pypes architecture and\ndesign.\n\nOutline:\n\n  * Brief intro to Stackless Python (benefits it provides) \n  * Control-Flow vs Data-Flow \n  * Preemptive vs Cooperative Scheduling \n  * The Topological Scheduler \n  * The REST API (Submitting Data - Asynchronous Web Service) \n  * Packet API: A unified data model with meta-data support \n  * Writing Custom Components - Paste templates and pluggable eggs \n  * Scale up - multiprocessing support \n  * Scale out - cloud friendly \n  * Questions \n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011LargeScaleDataConditioningProcessingWithStackl439.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 154817317, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/400_large-scale-data-conditioning-amp-processing-with-stackless-python-and-pypes.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.995"}, {"category": "PyCon US 2011", "language": "English", "slug": "pycon-2011--linguistics-of-twitter", "speakers": ["Michael D.

MapReduce is a relatively simple model to\ndevelop for that allows the underlying framework to automatically parallelize\nthe job, add fault tolerance, and scale the job to many commodity computers.\n\nIn 2009, Amazon Web Services introduced their Elastic MapReduce (EMR) product.\nIt layers the Hadoop open source package on top of their Elastic Compute Cloud\n(EC2) to allow anyone to rent a cluster of computers by the hour, starting at\nabout a dime per computer per hour, in order to run MapReduce jobs.\n\nSome of the significant issues with Amazon's solution involve starting up\nmachine instances, replicating your code and its dependancies to EMR, running\nand monitoring the job, and gathering the results.\n\nSo Yelp developed mrjob, which takes care of these details and lets the\ndeveloper focus on working with their data. Yelp uses mrjob to power many\ninternal jobs that work with its very large log files, for example:\n\n  * People Who Viewed This Also Viewed... \n  * A user clicked an ad over and over, but we only want to charge the advertiser once \n  * We're thinking of a change, but want to simulate how that will affect ad revenue \n\nNow you can use that same power with just a few lines of Python.\n\nUseful links:\n\n  * Install mrjob: sudo easy_install mrjob \n  * Documentation: [http://packages.python.org/mrjob/](http://packages.python.org/mrjob/)\n  * PyPI: [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mrjob](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mrjob)\n  * Development is hosted at github: [http://github.com/Yelp/mrjob](http://github.com/Yelp/mrjob)\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011MrjobDistributedComputingForEveryone940.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 142384088, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/404_mrjob-distributed-computing-for-everyone.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.001"}, {"category": "PyCon US 2011", "language": "English", "slug": "pycon-2011--opening-the-flask", "speakers": ["Armin Ronacher"], "tags": ["flask", "pycon", "pycon2011"], "related_urls": [], "id": 440, "state": 1, "title": "Opening the Flask", "summary": "", "description": "Opening the Flask\n\nPresented by Armin Ronacher\n\nAfter a year of the Flask microframework it's time to draw some conclusions,\nsee things that went right and things that should be improved.

Employing the optimization techniques within\nSciPy, the code performs a search for an optimal vector of parameters for\nestimating engine variables, including exhaust temperatures and thrust. The\nalgorithm exploits the numerical strengths of Python and SciPy for speed and\ninteroperability.\n\nAbstract\n\nAn emerging field of aircraft engine diagnostics is the inclusion of on-board\nengine performance tracking algorithms. These algorithms utilize data provided\nby a limited number of engine sensors to determine the current engine\nperformance, which tends to degrade over time. However, estimating engine\nperformance instantaneously is problematic due to the limited number of\nsensors normally available on a commercial aircraft engine.\n\nOne common practice is to estimate and track engine performance in software\nusing a Kalman filter, a mathematical construct for tuning a numerical model\nto better track actual measurements (1). A new technique has been devised to\noptimize the design of this filter in aircraft engine applications (2). An\noptimization procedure to aid in the design of the filter has been implemented\nin Python and exercised against the significant number of minimization and\noptimization strategies available in SciPy. The talk focuses on the design of\nthis optimization procedure in Python. The object-oriented nature of Python\noffers benefits over alternative numerical languages; speed, availability, and\nmaintainability played central roles in the selection of Python as the\nimplementation language. The availability of the multiprocessing module\nallowed for full utilization of modern multi-core CPUs, in contrast with often\nlimited commercial numerical computing packages, further improving\ncomputational speed.\n\nSome difficulties were encountered during this design exercise. Discussion of\nthese obstacles and their eventual solution is presented. Specifically,\niterative solvers for the discrete algebraic Riccati equation and the discrete\nLyapunov equation had to be authored in Python (3,4). Additional framework for\nworking with discrete state-space control systems was created, exploiting the\nobject-oriented features of the language (5).\n\nThe Python implementation was able to verify the solution of the optimization\nproblem. Comparison with an alternative, reference MATLAB implementation will\nbe presented briefly. The results of this research is planned to be presented\nat the American Society for Mechanical Engineers Turbo Expo 2011 Conference in\nJune, 2011 (6). The algorithm design in Python is meant to showcase the\nability to perform controls engineering tasks in the Python language\nefficiently.\n\n1. \u201cKalman Filter,\u201d Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter](ht\ntp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter)\n\n2.

We do want you to try this at home.\n\nAbstract\n\nGoogle\u2019s introduction of the Go language raised eyebrows in the Stackless\nPython community. Although very different languages, Go and Stackless Python\u2019s\nconcurrency model share a common ancestor: the Bell Labs family of languages\n(i.e., Newsqueak, Limbo). The common feature are channels: a synchronous\nmessage passing mechanism based on Tony Hoare\u2019s Communicating Sequential\nProcesses (CSP).\n\nBoth Go and Python have channels. However with the select language statement,\nGo has the ability to wait on multiple channels simultaneously. Select greatly\nsimplifies many concurrent programming problems. Stackless Python does not\nhave this feature. Other channel based languages also feature powerful\nconcurrency constructs. How hard would these constructs be to implement for\nStackless Python?\n\nThis talk explores the prototyping potential of stackless.py, the PyPy's\nframework's implementation of Stackless Python. The beauty of stackless.py is\nthat it is written in Python and implements much of Stackless Python's API!\nThe \"case study\" involves prototyping Go's select in stackless.py before\nreimplementing select in C based Stackless Python.\n\nDuring this talk, it will be shown how stackless.py can be used with CPython\nand the greenlet package (no need to install another Python). The audience\nwill also get an in depth look at how channels are implemented. Channels are\nat the heart of Stackless Python's message based concurrency model. Finally\nthe audience will gain insights into future directions of Stackless Python.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011PrototypingGosSelectWithStacklesspyForStackless735.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 128259672, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/438_prototyping-go-s-select-with-stackless-py-for-stackless-python.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.010"}, {"category": "PyCon US 2011", "language": "English", "slug": "pycon-2011--psf-funds-pypy", "speakers": [], "tags": ["psf", "pycon", "pycon2011", "pypy"], "related_urls": [], "id": 355, "state": 1, "title": "PSF funds PyPy", "summary": "", "description": "Maciej Fija?kowski, Armin Rigo, Alex Gaynor, Laura Creighton and Jacob Hall\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011PSFFundsPyPy160.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 12831984, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/355_psf-funds-pypy.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.012"}]}
