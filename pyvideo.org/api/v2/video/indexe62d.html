Came to Python via Zope in 1999. Worked at Digital Creations (aka Zope Corporation) until 2003.\n\n  * Primary author of: Pyramid web framework, Supervisor UNIX process control system, Deform form system, Repoze collection of middleware, and other unmentionables. Contributor to Zope, WebOb, and lots of other OSS projects.\n\n  * Quoting Glyph: \"I've been doing IRC support for 10 years, so I'm pretty much dead inside.\"\n\n## What is a Web Framework\n\n  * A web framework receives a request, calls user code in order to return a response. Everything else is a bonus.\n\n  * Arguments about how a web framework implements \"MVC\" are usually distractions. Django gets this right.\n\n## Django Docs Do It Right\n\n  * Django docs broke the Python documentation curve.\n\n  * Great resources for multiple audiences.\n\n## Django Views Do It Right\n\n  * No magical globals (request or response).\n\n  * Django view lookup and execution is very fast.\n\n## Django Forms Do It Right\n\n  * Decoupling of models from forms.\n\n  * Optional recoupling via modelforms.\n\n## Django Convenience vs. Explicitness\n\n  * No thread locals.\n\n## Django Extensibility Does It Right\n\n  * Replaceable backends for authentication.\n\n  * Replaceable backends for storage.\n\n  * Encourages an environment of plugins at different levels.\n\n## Django Defaults Do It Right\n\n  * Django provides people with unambiguous ways to solve 80% of their web development problems.\n\n  * Doesn't prevent specialization or use of external libraries.\n\n## Django Reality Does It Right\n\n  * Can't argue with success.\n\n  * Scores of very successful sites built using Django.\n\n## What is Pyramid\n\n  * Pyramid handles view lookup and execution and provides related convenience APIs. It also allows extensive configuration of these things.\n\n  * Pyramid is a corner of a corner of Django, magnified.\n\n  * James Bennett's PyCon 2012 \"Django In Depth\" tutorial: ~20 minutes out of 3 hours devoted to things that Pyramid actually does: low-level template API, view lookup and execution, HTTP responses, middleware.\n\n  * Pyramid is independent of any particular peristence system. It has no built-in form generation system. It does not prefer any particular templating system. It does not ship with an admininstrative application.\n\n  * Something like Pyramid could be used to build something like Django.\n\n## Pylons Project\n\n  * Project lead consolidation decision.\n\n  * Attempt to get Pylons, TurboGears and `repoze.bfg` communities rowing in the same direction.\n\n  * Pylons 1.x web framework shifted into \u201clegacy\u201d status. Maintained indefinitely.\n\n  * New development: Pyramid and related.\n\n  * Turbogears: wildcard.\n\n## Is Pyramid a Microframework?\n\n  * Pyramid is sort of microframework-like. You can write a Pyramid application in a single file.\n\n  * Self-identifying microframeworks tend to suggest application development patterns to its users which promote convenience over explicitness. Pyramid (for better or worse) does not do this, because it needs to be useful in larger systems where these patterns can lead to extensibility problems.\n\n  * In reality, the term \"microframework\" is a marketing term, not a technological term, so whether the answer is yes or no doesn't really matter too much unless you have a stake in the project.\n\n## Small Pyramid Program\n\n    \n    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server\n    from pyramid.config import Configurator\n    from pyramid.response import Response\n    \n    def hello_world(request):\n       return Response('Hello %(name)s!' % request.matchdict)\n    \n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n       config = Configurator()\n       config.add_route('hello', '/hello/{name}')\n       config.add_view(hello_world, route_name='hello')\n       app = config.make_wsgi_app()\n       server = make_server('0.0.0.0', 8080, app)\n       server.serve_forever()\n    \n\n## Pyramid and Python 3\n\n  * Pyramid's current release (1.3) supports Python 3.2+ (as well as Python 2.6 and 2.7).\n\n  * Most existing add-ons already ported. When feasible, we port add-on dependencies (`beaker`, `WebOb`, `zope.*` packages).\n\n  * We have a committment to Python 3. It involves lots of whining and bitching.\n\n## I'm No Genius\n\n  * Pyramid does things wrong. Many parts of Pyramid make me cringe. https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/wiki/Mistakes\n\n  * The grass is always greener.\n\n## Pyramid Docs\n\n  * Culture of documentation (if it's not documented, it's broken).\n\n  * Pyramid itself has ~800 printed pages of narrative and API documentation, plus a few hundred pages of \"cookbook\" material.\n\n  * Comprehensive but pretty dry.\n\n## Docs Pain\n\n  * Many pain points are related to plain old bad docs: our fault. Docs are at least 10X harder to write well than the associated code and take much longer. Most coders hate writing docs. I write lots of documentation but it's often not very good.\n\n  * But other pain points people experience when trying to learn Pyramid from its docs is due to poorly documented dependencies (setuptools). We need to redocument subsystems \"in context\", for better or worse. (HELP!)\n\n  * And some pain points are due to an audience mismatch; narrative documentation assumes people know \"Python\" _and_ \"the web\". They often need remedial help in one or both, which the docs don't provide.\n\n  * \"Chipin\" project raised ~$5K for documentation overhaul.\n\n## Pyramid Friends\n\n  * Colander/Deform: form handling.\n\n  * SQLAlchemy: SQL database connectivity and querying.\n\n  * Pyramid-specific add-ons like `pyramid_mailer`, `pyramid_zodbconn`, `pyramid_socketio`, `pyramid_mongodb`, and so forth.\n\n  * The typical Pyramid application makes use of some combination of add-ons.\n\n## Scaffolding\n\n  * A scaffold renders a project. A project is installable like any other setuptools distribution (it has a `setup.py`, etc).\n\n  * The project depends on some combination of Pyramid, Pyramid plugins, and other third-party libraries and frameworks.\n\n  * `zodb`, `alchemy` and `starter` scaffolds provided by Pyramid itself. Others are contributed to PyPI by third parties.\n\n## Bindings Packages\n\nA more generic package is specialized for convenient use under Pyramid via use\nof a bindings package.\n\n  * `deform` + `pyramid_deform`.\n\n  * `repoze.who` + `pyramid_who`.\n\n  * 2X documentation burden: document once in general package docs, document again in bindings docs. That's no fun.\n\n  * But this will happen anyway if your code is popular (Celery).\n\n## Higher Level Frameworks\n\n  * `ptah`\n\n  * `kotti`\n\n  * `poolyx`\n\n  * `substanced`\n\n## Packaging Is Like a Blast Shield\n\n  * A blast shield helps keep shrapnel out.\n\n  * It can also help keep shrapnel _in_.\n\n  * Shrapnel tends to penetrate anything not within a blast shield.\n\n  * Every piece of software eventually blows up.\n\n  * The more blast shields you have, the more the damage is contained.\n\n  * But blast shields obscure the landscape. More work required for users.\n\n  * More packages add more documentation and conceptual overhead, and more unwanted choice.\n\n## Django Avoids Setuptools\n\n  * Setup.py develop of django doesn't work.\n\n  * Avoidance of setuptools also prevents use of console scripts (e.g. django-admin).\n\n  * Django recreates some of the patterns that setuptools provides (i.e. test discovery hooks).\n\n  * Developers whom are ignorant of distribution issues are very confused when inevitably faced with them.\n\n## Django Avoids Setuptools (2)\n\n  * Django's defacto avoidance of setuptools is understandable. But it's not helping to improve Python packaging. Python packaging and distribution needs you very badly.\n\n  * Fewer documentation issues to cope with, but contributing to docs for setuptools would float all boats.\n\n## Subclassing Is Convenient\n\n  * You don't have to explain a protocol (the protocol is Python).\n\n  * But offering extensibility via subclassing is often a poorer choice than offering extensibility via composition and very explicit interfaces.\n\n  * Why? People begin depending upon the implementation details of the classes you tell them to subclass. Unless you're extremely clear about what the API of the superclass is, and the social contract to use nothing else but the documented API exists, you'll be pressured into making retroactive APIs. Impossible to recover from without breaking b/w compat.\n\n  * Not uncommon to see a subclass of a subclass of a subclass of a subclass; figuting out how the thing works can be an exercise in pain and multiple editor windows.\n\n## Globals are Convenient\n\n  * You don't have to explain a protocol for obtaining a value (the protocol is `import`).\n\n  * But the development of circular imports is inevitable.\n\n  * Global registries make it impossible to embed more than one application into the same Python process.\n\n## Module-Scope Work Is Convenient\n\nFrom Django tutorial, at module scope:\n\n    \n    from django.contrib import admin\n    admin.autodiscover()\n    \n\n## Module-Scope Work Is Convenient (2)\n\n  * These things can be done at module scope without concern:\n\n  * An import of another module or global.\n\n  * Assignment of a variable name in the module to some constant value.\n\n  * The addition of a function via a def statement.\n\n  * The addition of a class via a class statement.\n\n  * Control flow which may handles conditionals for platform-specific handling or failure handling of the above.\n\n  * Everything else is at least suspect. Test runners and other code scanners can import with abandon, and side effects are often undesirable.\n\n## Pluggable Apps / Reusable Apps\n\n  * Pluggable apps probably aren't really that pluggable, reusable apps probably aren't as reusable as you might like.\n\n  * IMO, even a framework as high-level as Django can't really offer such a feature without stretching the truth just a little bit.\n\n  * The only thing that can truly offer pluggable apps: another app. No general-purpose framework can do a great job here. (Examples: Wordpress, Jenkins, Plone).\n\n## Rendering Is Meta-View\n\n  * `render_to_response` using template in view is no fun to test.\n\n  * Returning a dict from a view callable is more fun to test.\n\n## Unit Tests\n\n  * Exclusive use of Django test client for tests will cause test suite to run more slowly than necessary.\n\n  * A slow enough test suite won't be run before commit.\n\n  * Testers who don't understand any type of testing other than \"system\" or \"integration\" testing tend to bring poor testing practices to unrelated systems.\n\n  * Using setuptools provides nice hooks for test discovery and execution.\n\n## Static Files\n\n  * Python WSGI servers are getting better at serving static files. E.g. Gunicorn supports `sendfile` on UNIX.\n\n  * Might be time to reconsider offloading media to a dedicated non-Python server and make use of what's available in WSGI-land.\n\n## Community\n\n  * Pyramid community is maybe 10% the size of the Django community.\n\n  * It's growing.\n\n  * Your success is our success. I'd be very pleased to have Pyramid be considered the #2 Python web framework (at least for \"Python people\"). Forever.\n\n## Collaboration (Low-Level)\n\n  * Create adapter for WebOb or Werkzeug that implements the Django request API?\n\n  * Create an adapter for SQLAlchemy that implements the Django ORM API?\n\n  * These are likely losers. They are \"30 year plans\". Things change so fast. Who will pay immediately? Who will benefit immediately?\n\n  * Might be better to try to use common non-domain-specific dependencies (e.g. setuptools, virtualenv, WSGI middleware, etc). It would be a great win to share documentation burden, even if we had to \"fork\" it for our own contextual requirements.\n\n## Collaboration (High-Level)\n\n  * Django is limited by backwards compatibility concerns. It's impractical to make large architectural changes now. Your users would kill you.\n\n  * But I could imagine somebody from the Django community creating a \"Django-NG\" or a Django-like system from whole cloth. Or break Django apart into something that isn't quite bw compatible.\n\n  * It might make sense to consider Pyramid or another smaller framework as a base for such an effort. If you used Pyramid, you'd get URL routing, internationalization, template bindings, configuration extensibility, flexible view lookup and execution, an event system, security, documentation, Python 3 compatibility, and other things. `ptah` is such a system right now.\n\n  * Pyramid community is very enthusiastic, friendly, helpful, and experienced.\n\n## Promoting Python\n\n  * I challenge you to not be complacent.\n\n  * I challenge you to investigate how other frameworks work.\n\n  * I challenge you to embrace existing Python packaging and distribution tools.\n\n  * I challenge you to port quickly to Python 3. Commit to supporting it in your add-ons and helping folks who have existing add-ons port.\n\n  * I challenge you to speak out when folks bash competitors. Haters are everywhere, and when someone bashes Pyramid, Flask, Bottle, or Zope, and nobody defends against it, the hate will eventually come back to harm you.\n\n## Unknowns\n\n  * Django Class-Based Views Might Not Do It Right. `as_view`. Hmm. All views in Pyramid are potentially generic. They have a context passed to them. Class-based views in Pyramid are not things handed down from \"good devs\" to reuse, they're just normal things.\n\n  * How does Django allow for configuration extensibility? Conflict detection?\n\n  * Event system\n\n  * Alternate templating languages\n\n  * Exception views\n\n  * View predicates\n\n  * Transaction management\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/eN7h6ZbzMy0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/eN7h6ZbzMy0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/eN7h6ZbzMy0/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN7h6ZbzMy0", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2012-09-06", "added": "2012-10-08T17:39:52", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.966"}, {"category": "DjangoCon 2012", "language": "English", "slug": "accelerating-and-enhancing-django-with-redis", "speakers": ["Joshua Ginsberg"], "tags": ["django", "redis"], "related_urls": [], "id": 1410, "state": 1, "title": "Accelerating and Enhancing Django with Redis", "summary": "This tutorial introduces Redis, an in-memory key-object NoSQL datastore.

But once it's off the\nground, the Redis key-object store provides a versatile and functional way to\ntake your app to the next level of performance and function with minimal\nengineering.\n\n[Redis](http://redis.io) is an in-memory key-object database that can perform\nstandard operations on simple values, lists, sets, hash maps, and scored sets\nwith incredible efficiency. While it cannot and should not replace SQL for\nschema-defined, persistent data storage, it can provide dramatically faster\noperational efficiency for volatile, temporary, or rapidly changing data with\nminimal coding required.\n\nThis talk begins by introducing Redis, its basic featureset, and the data\ntypes and operations it supports. We'll cover some high-level guidelines and\nstrategies for identifying where Redis may be an appropriate performance-\nenhancing solution. We then cover the out-of-the-box ways that Redis can\nimprove a Django application as a cache, session store, Celery broker, and\nmore. We'll then proceed to more advanced usage possibilities, implementing a\nreal-time websocket based messaging solution, scripting within Redis using its\nembedded Lua interpreter, and connecting Redis to PostgreSQL using Foreign\nData Wrappers to efficiently blend SQL tables with Redis data.\n\nBy the end of the presentation, you should be able to use all of the data-\nstructures offered by Redis, to identify opportunities within you codebase\nthat Redis may offer simple but dramatic efficiency improvements, and to\nenvision how advanced Redis usage may bring new and cutting-edge functionality\nto your project.\n\nRedis was developed by [Salvatore Sanfilippo](http://twitter.com/antirez) and\n[Pieter Noordhuis](http://twitter.com/pnoordhuis), who are both supported by\nVMWare to develop the database full-time.

This talk is aimed at Django developers of\nall levels who are interested in getting an overview of the great\npossibilities Vagrant offers to support teamwork and quality assurance.\n\nOne major benefit of using Vagrant is with on-boarding. Previously, when new\ndevelopers joined a project, it could take hours or days for them to correctly\nset up their development environment and install all the projects'\ndependencies (the correct version of Python, the virtualenv, the database\nserver, the caching engine, etc.). With Vagrant, combined with provisioning\ntools like Chef or Puppet, it is now possible to easily create a virtual\nmachine with all the right dependencies properly pre-installed and pre-\nconfigured to allow anyone to be fully operational and ready to contribute to\nthe project in a matter of minutes.\n\nAnother major benefit of Vagrant is that it gives the opportunity to create a\nworking environment for all developers that closely matches that of the\nproduction server. This in turn allows to anticipate potential issues when new\ncode and resources eventually get deployed live.\n\nIn this talk, I will present some key functionalities and workflows around the\nuse of Vagrant: - installing Vagrant and Virtualbox. - creating a new virtual\nmachine. - provisioning a virtual machine with basic requirements. - sharing\nvirtual machine specifications with team members.\n\nThis talk will include a brief introduction to Chef and Puppet. It will also\ninclude multiple practical tricks like accessing the VM's database server from\nthe host's machine, setting up useful shell aliases or automatically\nactivating the virtualenv when launching the VM.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/DsYVx-mh3NE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/DsYVx-mh3NE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/DsYVx-mh3NE/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsYVx-mh3NE", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2012-09-06", "added": "2012-10-08T17:39:53", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.970"}, {"category": "DjangoCon 2012", "language": "English", "slug": "building-pci-compliant-django-applications", "speakers": ["Ken Cochrane"], "tags": ["django", "pci-complicance"], "related_urls": [], "id": 1411, "state": 1, "title": "Building PCI compliant Django applications", "summary": "If you currently accept credit cards with your Django application today, or\nyou plan on accepting them in the future, then you will need to worry about\nPCI DSS.

Realize that building the sample app was cute but nothing compared to writing a real world application with real users and real constraints.\n  5. Re-read the docs.\n  6. Build a real Django app -- no more Polls. I decided to build a single-sign on application that allowed Etsy sellers to login and view all the photos of their all their listings in one place. I will give background as to why I chose this app, how I built it, and what it taught me.\n  7. Start biting off small pieces of production code to figure out what the hell is going on. Learn about commonly used Django packages such as django-registration, django-profiles, taggit, etc. - and what happens when you need to modify the code of those packages.\n  8. Attempt to boil the ocean, again. I needed to do a massive re- architecture of our application, combining several independent Django applications into a single, unified Django project. My first attempt totally failed. I will discuss why this was and key novice mistakes.\n  9. Key realization that knowing Django != knowing Python\n  10. \"When you bang your head enough against the wall, eventually the wall comes down\" -- me.

We discuss how\nto uphold the API provider/ consumer separation, yet utilize provider's django\nform subsystem to power forms in a pure JS consumer. We achieve this by\nserializing form configurations, rendering metadata, error handlers & exposing\nthem over API.\n\n", "description": "In our quest to modularize the architecture of web applications, we create\nself-containing backend systems that provide web APIs for programmatic\ninteractions. This gives us the flexibility to separate different system\ncomponents. A system with multiple backend components e.g. user profile\nengine, content engine, community engine, analytics engine may have a single\nfrontend application that fetches data from all of these components using\nrespective web APIs.\n\nWith the increased availability of powerful JavaScript frameworks, such\nfrontend applications are often purely JS based to decrease application\nfootprint, increase deployment flexibility and separate presentation from\ndata. The separation is very rewarding from a software engineering standpoint\nbut imposes several limitations on system design. Using django to construct\nthe API for arbitrary consumers comes with the limitation of not being able to\nutilize the powerful django form subsystem to drive forms on these consumers.\nBut is there a way to overcome this restriction?\n\nThis is not a trivial problem to solve and there are only a few assumptions we\ncan make about the web API consumer. It can be a native mobile or desktop -\napplication or browser. We advocate that web APIs should provide sufficient\ninformation about 'forms' so that they can be faithfully reproduced at the\nconsumer end.\n\nEven in a API backend built using django, forms are essential for accepting,\nfiltering, processing and saving data. The django form subsystem provides many\nuseful features to accomplish these tasks. At the same time it facilitates the\nprocess of rendering the form elements in a browser environment. The concepts\nof form fields combined with widgets can go a long way in streamlining the\ninterface to interact with data.\n\nWe propose an architecture to serialize information about django forms (to\nJSON) in a framework independent fashion so that it can be consumed by any\nfrontend application that renders HTML. Such information includes but is not\nlimited to basic form configurations, security tokens (if necessary),\nrendering metadata and error handling instructions. We lovingly name this\narchitecture - django-remote-forms.\n\nAt WiserTogether, we are in the process of building a component based\narchitecture that strictly provides data endpoints for frontend applications\nto consume. We are working towards developing our frontend application for web\nbrowsers using backbone.js as MVC and handlebars as the templating engine.\ndjango-remote-forms helps us streamline our data input interface with the\ndjango forms living at the API backend.\n\nIn this talk we detail the architecture of our components, the mechanism of\ndelivering django form metadata over API and a backbone.js/ handlebars\nimplementation to consume the metadata and reproduce forms.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/fwXEJh63sKc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/fwXEJh63sKc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/fwXEJh63sKc/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwXEJh63sKc", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2012-09-05", "added": "2012-10-08T17:39:49", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.986"}, {"category": "DjangoCon 2012", "language": "English", "slug": "flasky-goodness-or-why-django-sucks", "speakers": ["Kenneth Reitz"], "tags": ["flask"], "related_urls": [], "id": 1386, "state": 1, "title": "Flasky Goodness (or Why Django Sucks?)", "summary": "This talk dives into the specifics of why Django isn't always the best tool\nfor the job, general frustrations with the framework, and potential fixes.
