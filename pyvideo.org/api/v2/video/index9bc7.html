We all know how useless and frustrating out-of-date or just plain incorrect documentation is. In this talk I'd like to demonstrate how Python can help make writing documentation, keeping it up-to-date and verifying its validity. It can be surprising what happens when other people discover your little-but-well-documented API.\nPython has several built-in concepts and standard tools to help making this easier, such as docstrings, help(), Sphinx, Sphinx plugins, Doctests and generating documentation off tests themselves.\nI'll focus on not only using Sphinx as a tool, but also on how to structure your application/library/tool so as to make writing accurate documentation as simple as possible.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful.thumbs/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-_000150.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://archive.org/details/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful", "whiteboard": "ia scrape", "recorded": "2014-10-03", "added": "2015-08-22T21:43:28.154", "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:28.154"}, {"category": "PyCon ZA 2014", "language": "English", "slug": "inspired-by-lisp-to-get-ruby-to-talk-python", "speakers": ["Martin Pretorius"], "tags": ["pyconza", "pyconza2014"], "related_urls": [], "id": 3829, "state": 1, "title": "Inspired by Lisp to get Ruby to talk Python", "summary": "Having pushed Ruby to the limits of what it can accomplish in terms of number crunching and data analysis, we looked around for another solution in the data analysis and modelling space.

It utilises an asynchronous, event driven model which allows the rapid development of custom network protocols. While Twisted makes implementing network services much easier, it comes with its own set of challenges. One of these challenges involves tracking the context of multiple requests. In a traditional web server the thread ID could be used to track a particular request and modify log entries appropriately. However, this does not work in Twisted as it utilises a single thread (generally speaking).\nWe have chosen to tackle this issue, amongst others, by monkey patching some of the Twisted subsystems.\nThrough this talk we will introduce Twisted as a viable option for programming network based services. No previous Twisted knowledge is required, and the concepts introduced will be explained through real world examples of restful controllers implemented in Twisted.
