One can think of checkpoint-restart as a generalization of pickling. Instead of saving an object to a file, one saves the entire Python session to a file. Checkpointing Python visualization software is as easy as checkpointing a VNC session with Python running inside.\n\nA DMTCP plugin can be built in the form of a Python module. This Python module provides functions by which a Python session can checkpoint itself to disk. The same ideas extend to IPython.\n\nTwo classical uses of this feature are a saveWorkspace function (including visualization and the distributed processes of IPython). In addition, at least three novel uses of DMTCP for helping debug Python are demonstrated.\n\nFReD[2] --- a Fast Reversible Debugger that works closely with the Python pdb debugger, as well as other Python debuggers.\n\nReverse Expression Watchpoint --- A bug occurred in the past. It is associated with the point in time when a certain expression changed. Bring the user back to a pdb session at the step before the bug occurred.\n\nFast/Slow Computation[3] --- Cython provides both traditional interpreted functions and compiled C functions. Interpreted functions are slow, but correct. Compiled functions are fast, but users sometimes define them incorrectly, whereupon the compiled function silently returns a wrong answer. The idea of fast/slow computation is to run the compiled version on one core, with checkpoints at frequent intervals, and to copy a checkpoint to another core. The second core re-runs the computation over that interval, but in interpreted mode.\n\n[1]DMTCP: Transparent Checkpointing for Cluster Computations and the Desktop. Ansel, Arya, Cooperman.

Thus, generalizing or extending various algorithms to handle anisotropic rectangular sampled data is necessary. Our improvements to one such algorithm were recently contributed back to the community, and are presently incorporated in the random walker segmentation algorithm in Scikit-Image.\n\nAnother significant challenge is visualization of algorithm output for large volumetric datasets.

Given that a lot of research work uses mathematical tools and relies on modern high performance computers for numerical computation, obtaining reproducible floating-point computation results becomes fundamentally important in ensuring that research work is reproducible.\n\nIt is well understood that, generally, operations involving IEEE floating-point numbers are not associative. For example, (a+b)+c may not equal a+(b+c). Different orders of operations may lead to different results. But exploiting parallelism in modern performance-oriented computer systems has typically implied out-of-order execution. This poses a great challenge to researchers who need exactly the same numerical results from run to run, and across different systems.\n\nThis talk describes how to use tools such as Intel\u00ae Math Kernel Library (Intel\u00ae MKL) and Intel\u00ae compilers to build numerical reproducibility into Python based tools. Intel\u00ae MKL includes a feature called Conditional Numerical Reproducibility that allows users to get reproducible floating-point results when calling functions from the library. Intel\u00ae compilers provide broader solutions to ensure the compiler-generated code produces reproducible results. We demonstrate that scientific computing with Python can be numerically reproducible without losing much of the performance offered by modern computers. Our discussion focuses on providing different levels of controls to obtain reproducibility on the same system, across multiple generations of Intel architectures, and across Intel architectures and Intel-compatible architectures. Performance impact of each level of controls is discussed in detail. Our conclusion is that, there is usually a certain degree of trade-off between reproducibility and performance. The approach we take gives the end users many choices of balancing the requirement of reproducible results with the speed of computing.\n\nThis talk uses NumPy/SciPy as an example, but the principles and the methodologies presented apply to any Python tools for scientific computing.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/GIlp4rubv8U?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/GIlp4rubv8U?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/GIlp4rubv8U/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlp4rubv8U", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2013-07-02", "added": "2013-07-04T10:08:36", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.346"}, {"category": "SciPy 2013", "language": "English", "slug": "iris-cartopy-python-packages-for-atmospheric-a", "speakers": [], "tags": ["Tech"], "related_urls": [], "id": 1990, "state": 1, "title": "Iris & Cartopy: Python packages for Atmospheric and Oceanographic science; SciPy 2013 Presentation", "summary": "Iris & Cartopy: Open source Python packages for Atmospheric and Oceanographic science\n\nAuthors: Elson, Philip, UK Met Office;\n\nTrack: Meteorology, Climatology, Atmospheric and Oceanic Science\n\nAs the capabilities of Python packages valuable to the Atmospheric and Oceanographic Sciences (AOS) such as matplotlib, scipy and numpy have developed, so the UK Met Office's use of Python has expanded.

Since new algorithms are built on existing ones, just as theorems are derived from existing results, it would be natural to expect that the code produced for one project will be useful later on, to both the same researcher and others.\n\nWhile theorems blissfully stay intact over time, software deteriorates and ages. Implementations need to be updated with respect to changes in underlying libraries and hardware architectures. Even if up to date, software developed for a specific application area often needs to be adapted to new situations. Like proofs can be reused by taking some components intact and modifying certain parts, software needs similar adaptations to be reusable.\n\nIt is natural that researchers cannot commit any more time than absolutely necessary for distributing and maintaining their software. The lmonade project aims to provide infrastructure and tools to foster code sharing and openness in scientific software development by\n\nsimplifying the tasks of distributing software with its dependencies,\nensuring that it can be built on different platforms, and\nmaking sure the software is compatible across new releases of its dependencies.\nThis is achieved through\n\na light-weight meta distribution which can be installed by a user without administrative rights. Building on the Gentoo Linux distribution and the Gentoo Prefix project, lmonade creates a uniform environment for software development where latest versions of scientific libraries can be found easily.\naccess to a continuous integration infrastructure to detect compatibility problems between new versions of packages automatically and warn authors.\nBy simplifying code sharing and distribution, especially when complex dependencies are involved, this platform enables researchers to build on existing tools without fear of losing users to baffling installation instructions.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/7RuSFfCv4Ak?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/7RuSFfCv4Ak?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/7RuSFfCv4Ak/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RuSFfCv4Ak", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2013-07-02", "added": "2013-07-04T10:08:31", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.349"}, {"category": "SciPy 2013", "language": "English", "slug": "massive-online-collaborative-research-and-modelin", "speakers": [], "tags": ["Tech"], "related_urls": [], "id": 1981, "state": 1, "title": "Massive Online Collaborative Research and Modeling using Synapse and Python; SciPy 2013 Presentation", "summary": "Authors: Omberg, Larsson, Sage Bionetworks\n\nTrack: Bioinformatics\n\nSynapse is an open source software as a service (SaaS) platform built by Sage Bionetworks to enable collaborative and reproducible science.

Neurotrends identifies relevant research reports using the PubMed API, downloads and parses full-text HTML and PDF documents, and extracts hundreds of methodological details from this unstructured text.\n\nIn the present study, NeuroTrends was evaluated using a corpus of over 16,000 journal articles. Automatically extracted methodological meta-data were validated against a hand-coded database. Overall, methodological details were extracted accurately, with a mean d-prime value of 3.53 (range: 1.12 to 6.18). Results revealed both variability and stability in methodological practices over time, with some methods increasing in prevalence, some decreasing, and others remaining consistent. Results also showed that design and analysis pipelines were highly variable across studies and have grown more variable over time.\n\nIn sum, the present study confirms the feasibility of accurately extracting methodological meta-data from unstructured text. We also contend that variability in research methods across time and from study to study poses a challenge to reproducibility in the neuroimaging literature--and likely in many other fields as well.

The Hydrodynamic and Oil Spill model Python (hyospy) wrapper was developed to run a hydrodynamic model, link with the oil spill, and visualize results. Hyospy completes the following steps automatically: (1) downloads wind and tide data (nowcast, forecast and historical); (2) converts data to hydrodynamic model input; (3) initializes a sequence of hydrodynamic models starting at pre-defined intervals on multi-processor workstation, and (4) provides visualization on Google Earth. Each model starts from the latest observed data, so that the multiple models provide a range of forecast hydrodynamics with different initial and boundary conditions reflecting different forecast horizons. As a simple testbed for integration and visualization strategies, a Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) particle transport method is used for spill transport. The model forecast uncertainty is estimated by the difference between forecasts in the sequenced model runs.

Many of these techniques converge to the same or qualitatively similar solutions, so I will briefly mention some recent results that indicate the encoding can be more important than the specific features that are used (Coates & Ng, 2011).", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/nT4SGi-aaMU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/nT4SGi-aaMU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/nT4SGi-aaMU/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT4SGi-aaMU", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2013-07-02", "added": "2013-07-04T10:08:46", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.361"}, {"category": "SciPy 2013", "language": "English", "slug": "reproducible-documents-with-pythontex-scipy-2013", "speakers": [], "tags": ["Tech"], "related_urls": [], "id": 2002, "state": 1, "title": "Reproducible Documents with PythonTeX; SciPy 2013 Presentation", "summary": "Authors: Poore, Geoffrey, Union University\n\nTrack: Reproducible Science\n\nWriting a scientific document can be slow and error-prone. When a figure or calculation needs to be modified, the code that created it must be located, edited, and re-executed. When data changes or analysis is tweaked, everything that depends on it must be updated. PythonTeX is a LaTeX package that addresses these issues by allowing Python code to be included within LaTeX documents. Python code may be entered adjacent to the figure or calculation it produces. Built-in utilities may be used to track dependencies.\n\nPythonTeX maximizes performance and efficiency. All code output is cached, so that documents can be compiled without executing code. Code is only re-executed when user-specified criteria are met, such as exit status or modified dependencies. In many cases, dependencies can be detected and tracked automatically. Slow code may be isolated in user-defined sessions, which automatically run in parallel. Errors and warnings are synchronized with the document so that they have meaningful line numbers.\n\nSince PythonTeX documents mix LaTeX and Python code, they are less portable than plain LaTeX documents. PythonTeX includes a conversion utility that creates a new copy of a document in which all Python code is replaced by its output. The result is suitable for journal submission or conversion to other formats such as HTML.\n\nWhile PythonTeX is primarily intended for Python, its design is largely language-independent. Users may easily add support for additional languages.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/G-UDHc2UVOg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/G-UDHc2UVOg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/G-UDHc2UVOg/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-UDHc2UVOg", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2013-07-02", "added": "2013-07-04T10:08:37", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.363"}, {"category": "SciPy 2013", "language": "English", "slug": "scikit-fuzzy-a-new-scipy-toolkit-for-fuzzy-logic", "speakers": [], "tags": ["Tech"], "related_urls": [], "id": 2019, "state": 1, "title": "Scikit-Fuzzy: A New SciPy Toolkit for Fuzzy Logic; SciPy 2013 Presentation", "summary": "Authors: Warner, Joshua, Mayo Clinic Department of Biomedical Engineering; Ottesen, Hal H., Adjunct Professor\n\nTrack: General\n\nScikit-fuzzy is a robust set of foundational tools for problems involving fuzzy logic and fuzzy systems. This area has been a challenge for the scientific Python community, largely because the common first exposure to this topic is through the MATLAB\u00ae Fuzzy Logic Toolbox\u2122. This talk officially introduces a general set of original fuzzy logic algorithms to the scientific Python community which predate the commercial toolbox, were released under the 3-clause BSD license, and were translated to Python by an author who never used the MathWorks\u00c2\u00ae Fuzzy Logic Toolbox\u2122.\n\nThe current capabilities of scikit-fuzzy include: fuzzy membership function generation; fuzzy set operations; lambda-cuts; fuzzy mathematics including Zadeh's extension principle, the vertex method, and the DSW method; fuzzy implication given an IF THEN system of fuzzy rules (via Mamdani [min] or Larsen [product] implication); various defuzzification algorithms; fuzzy c-means clustering; and Fuzzy Inference Ruled by Else-action (FIRE) denoising of 1d or 2d signals.\n\nThe goals of scikit-fuzzy are to provide the community with a robust toolkit of independently developed and implemented fuzzy logic algorithms, filling a void in the capabilities of scientific and numerical Python, and to increase the attractiveness of scientific Python as a valid alternative to closed-source options.
