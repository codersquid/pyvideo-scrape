How about servers\nin racks with power boards attached (and cords running across the room to\nremote boards)? Come along to see one approach to create minimal and well-\nperforming models for such real-life situations.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe slightly over-simplified but useful rule of thumb when creating database\nschema is \u201cnormalize until it hurts, [then] denormalize until it works.\u201d If\nonly people didn\u2019t skip the first step so often. Using a data modeling layer,\nsuch as Django's models, doesn't absolve the system architects from the need\nto create good design. It also doesn't require them to do so, since you can\nget away with a lot of sub-optimality with many data sets.\n\nThe real difficulty here, though, is that the trade-off between text-book\nideal modeling and easy to use is difficult to judge and takes practice to\ndevelop.\n\nThis talk will walk some interesting cases of model design that I've\nencountered recently. I'll explain how I approached the problem and what we\nended up with. These will include:\n\n  * Modeling people who might simultaneously play different roles in the system. For example, a person who was a baseball player and then became a coach \u2014 each role has different attributes attached to it. \n  * Modeling what appears to be a triangular dependency relationship with minimal redundancy in the data description and without needing really long query filters to access things. \n  * Handling date ranges (or other measured data) of different degrees of accuracy and precision. \n\nThis won't be a talk on theoretical database design. Rather, concrete examples\nof creating such designs and guiding the decisions by what might work best in\nthe final Django code. Hopefully, by listening to one person's approach\n(mine!), people faced with similar challenges will have another possible\nattack method in their toolbox.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Robertlofthouse-ModelingChallenges314.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 236827444, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/djangocon-2010/42_modeling-challenges.flv", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.586"}, {"category": "DjangoCon 2011", "language": "English", "slug": "djangocon-2011--monkeying-around-with-python-at-n", "speakers": ["Graham Dumpleton"], "tags": ["djangocon", "djangocon2011", "exceptions", "memcache", "monitoring", "performance", "requests", "transactions"], "related_urls": [], "id": 104, "state": 1, "title": "Monkeying Around with Python at New Relic", "summary": "", "description": "Monkeying around with Python at New Relic\n\nPresented by Graham Dumpleton\n\nThis session will cover the challenges of creating a production application\nperformance monitoring system for Python.

We'll talk about the strengths and\nweaknesses of each pattern and why you might not need any of them.\n\nAbstract\n\nThere are a few good reasons a system might want to interact regularly with\nmultiple databases. \u201cBecause it\u2019s what cool people do\u201d is not one of those\nreasons. Most multi-database usages fall into one of four main classes:\n\n  * Separation by function. All data of one type in one database, all data of another type in some other database. \n  * Separation by sharding. Data of a particular type (e.g. user records) is split across multiple databases, each database holding a shard of the whole data. \n  * Data replication (separation by access). Some pieces of data are synchronized to multiple machines. Writes might go into one or more masters and reads normally come from the slaves. \n  * Data augmentation/shadowing. Data in one database is added to or entirely replaced by data from another database. Can happen during development when reading from a production snapshot whilst trying out changes to some tables or data only against a local database. \n\nObviously, combinations of these classes are possible, such as replicated\nsharded data in a huge site. There are tricks and traps to the way a developer\ntalks to each of these sorts of setups. I'll spend a few minutes showing\ncredible examples of the usage of each as well as when you might be over-\nengineering by going that way. All four access patterns are possible in Django\n1.2, with varying degrees of ease of use and I'll show the type of code\nrequired in each case.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Robertlofthouse-MultidatabasePatterns241.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 215779342, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/djangocon-2010/38_multi-database-patterns.flv", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.589"}, {"category": "DjangoCon 2009", "language": "English", "slug": "no--bad-pony", "speakers": ["Dr. Russell Keith-Magee"], "tags": ["djangocon", "djangocon2009", "ponies"], "related_urls": [], "id": 3, "state": 1, "title": "No!

Hidden Markov Models to improve activity recognition in patients with spinal cord injury and Innate learning: training the brain before the eyes open.", "description": "### Hidden Markov Models to improve activity recognition in patients with spinal cord injury  \r\nBy: Asma Mehjabeen\r\n\r\nFitness tracking is great for calories and steps, but similar sensors are capable of reporting much more about how we move throughout the day. This is especially important in assessing the quality of movement for those with limited mobility. Doctors often want to know more detail about patient behavior after therapy to select and adjust the appropriate intervention. Using machine learning on wearable accelerometer signals, we estimate the activities patients with incomplete spinal cord injury are performing. By combining windowed classifier estimates over time using a hidden markov model, we show how error rates can be significantly decreased, which brings more detailed assessments of patient activity closer to a clinical reality.\r\n\r\n### Innate learning: training the brain before the eyes open  \r\nBy: Isaac Adorno\r\n\r\nAmorphous, blob-like patterns of neural activity form and move over the eye during visual development in animals. Why do such patterns exist? We show that these patterns are this way to better prepare the visual system for natural vision. Essentially, these are movies played in the eyes to refine the visual system before the eyes even open. We use python to model the developing visual system, produce an efficient code based on those patterns, and show how that code matches what is seen biologically.
