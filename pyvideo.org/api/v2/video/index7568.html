With cython, you can add type information to your Python code to yield dramatic performance improvements. Cython also allows you to wrap C, C++ and Fortran libraries to work with Python and NumPy. It is used extensively in research environments and in end-user applications.\n\nThis hands-on tutorial will cover Cython from the ground up, and will include the newest Cython features, including typed memoryviews.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nDevelopers, researchers, scientists, and engineers who use Python and NumPy and who routinely hit bottlenecks and need improved performance.\n\nC / C++ / Fortran users who would like their existing code to work with Python.\n\nExpected level of knowledge:\n\nIntermediate and / or regular user of Python and NumPy. Have used Python's decorators, exceptions, and classes. Knowledge of NumPy arrays, array views, fancy indexing, and NumPy dtypes. Have programmed in at least one of C, C++, or Fortran.\n\nSome familiarity with the Python or NumPy C-API a plus. Familiarity with memoryviews and buffers a plus. Familiarity with OpenMP a plus.

Do you want to extend NumPy (e.g. adding support for decimal, or arbitrary precision) ? Are you curious to understand how NumPy works at all ? Then this tutorial is for you.\n\nThe goal of this tutorial is do dive into NumPy codebase, in particular the core C implementation. You will learn how to build NumPy from sources, how some of the core concepts such as data types and ufuncs are implemented at the C level and how it is hooked up to the Python runtime. You will also learn how to add a new ufunc and a new data type.\n\nDuring the tutorial, we will also have a look at various tools (unix-oriented) that can help tracking bugs or follow a particular numpy expression from its python representation to its low-level implementation.\n\nWhile a working knowledge of C and Python is required, we do not assume a preliminary knowledge of the NumPy codebase. An understanding of Python C extensions is a plus, but not required either.\n\nOutline\n\nThe tutorial will be divided in 3 main sections:\n\nIntroduction:\nWhy extending numpy in C ?

This set of tutorials will introduce the basics of machine learning, and how these learning tasks can be accomplished using Scikit-Learn, a machine learning library written in Python and built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. By the end of the tutorials, participants will be poised to take advantage of Scikit-learn's wide variety of machine learning algorithms to explore their own data sets. The tutorial will comprise two sessions, Session I in the morning (intermediate track), and Session II in the afternoon (advanced track). Participants are free to attend either one or both, but to get the most out of the material, we encourage those attending in the afternoon to attend in the morning as well.\n\nSession II will build upon Session I, and assume familiarity with the concepts covered there. The goals of Session II are to introduce more involved algorithms and techniques which are vital for successfully applying machine learning in practice. It will cover cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization, unsupervised algorithms, pipelines, and go into depth on a few extremely powerful learning algorithms available in Scikit-learn: Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Sparse Models. We will finish with an extended exercise applying scikit-learn to a real-world problem.\n\nOutline\n\nTutorial 2 (advanced track)\n\n0:00 - 0:30 -- Model validation and testing\nBias, Variance, Over-fitting, Under-fitting\nUsing validation curves & learning to improve your model\nExercise: Tuning a random forest for the digits data\n0:30 - 1:30 -- In depth with a few learners\nSVMs and kernels\nTrees and forests\nSparse and non-sparse linear models\n1:30 - 2:00 -- Unsupervised Learning\nExample of Dimensionality Reduction: hand-written digits\nExample of Clustering: Olivetti Faces\n2:00 - 2:15 -- Pipelining learners\nExamples of unsupervised data reduction followed by supervised learning.\n2:15 - 2:30 -- Break (possibly in the middle of the previous section)\n2:30 - 3:00 -- Learning on big data\nOnline learning:\nMiniBatchKmeans\nStochastic Gradient Descent for linear models\nData-reducing transforms: random-projections\n3:00 - 4:00 -- Parallel Machine Learning with IPython\nIPython.parallel, a short primer\nParallel Model Assessment and Selection\nRunning a cluster on the EC2 cloud using StarCluster\n\nhttps://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_scipy2013\n\nRequired Packages\n\nThis tutorial will use Python 2.6 / 2.7, and require recent versions of numpy (version 1.5+), scipy (version 0.10+), matplotlib (version 1.1+), scikit-learn (version 0.13.1+), and IPython (version 0.13.1+) with notebook support. The final requirement is particularly important: participants should be able to run IPython notebook and create & manipulate notebooks in their web browser.
