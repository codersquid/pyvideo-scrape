One day, you wake up and you have the urge to make them suffer. Well, there\u2019s no better way to do so than breaking the software they\u2019re using.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll walk you through very good ways to do so by showing examples taken from experience - because experience is the only thing that matters (TM) - so that you\u2019ll be able, by the time this talk ends, to do the same to your users.\r\n\r\n(P.S: If you\u2019ve a kinder hearth, you can also do the exact opposite of what I\u2019ll say and keep your users happy.)\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "embed": "<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/VZp7iWOKJ_A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VZp7iWOKJ_A/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZp7iWOKJ_A", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2015-08-04", "added": "2015-10-18T16:10:55.767", "updated": "2015-10-18T16:10:55.767"}, {"category": "PyCon AU 2015", "language": "English", "slug": "build-a-better-hat-rack-all-contributions-welcom-0", "speakers": ["Katie McLaughlin"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [], "id": 4001, "state": 1, "title": "Build a Better Hat Rack: All Contributions Welcome", "summary": "", "description": "We have many ways of reporting and recognising our code contributions in open source projects, but often it is the work we do outside of code commits themselves that get forgotten and unattributed.

However, each package has its own strengths and limitations depending on the purpose of the analysis. After testing many of them at work, we have found a need to develop our own packages (at the Brain Imaging Laboratory, MBC). We will expose a couple of python tools that could be handy for anyone dealing with neuroscience (or medical images in general) in their projects. The tools presented are for (i.) quick image viewing, (ii.) dicom image sorting and de-identifying and (iii.) automatic email notifications to alert about server warnings (e.g., if machine is down, close to full capacity, failing to connect to local image archiving network (PACS), etc..). While many of these tools could have been written in other programming languages, we will explain the reasons for choosing python, share a bit about our python learning journey and perform a brief demonstration on the command line.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "embed": "<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZA05sGM6UfA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZA05sGM6UfA/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA05sGM6UfA", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2015-08-04", "added": "2015-10-18T16:10:56.400", "updated": "2015-10-18T16:10:56.400"}, {"category": "PyCon AU 2015", "language": "English", "slug": "docker-python", "speakers": ["Tim Butler"], "tags": [], "related_urls": [], "id": 3962, "state": 1, "title": "Docker + Python", "summary": "", "description": "Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.
