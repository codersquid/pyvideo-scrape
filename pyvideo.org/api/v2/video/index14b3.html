But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. In August 2015 we released OpenCanary, the Open Source version of our commercial Python-based honeypot. \r\n\r\nTraditional honeypots aim to reveal attacker tools, techniques and procedures, by entrapping attackers through emulation (or instrumentation) of common protocols and services. They are typically installed standalone, and seldom updated. We argue that this honeypot approach is outdated; current organisations struggle far more with <em>identifying breaches</em> than identifying the version of some generic rootkit installed post-breach. \r\n\r\nOpenCanary changes that, treating the honeypot as an internal distributed sensor rather than a standalone alert generator. Each event reported is a high-quality indicator of investigation-worthy activity, and each OpenCanary instance feeds event data to a correlator which produces single alerts even in the face of network-wide scans. With such a high signal-to-noise ratio, every alert requires investigation. This is in contrast to the stream of alerts produced by tools such as anti-virus, network IDS or traditional honeypots.\r\n\r\nOpenCanary wound up relying on Python for the majority of the code. The Python eco-system provided support that sped up development and, more importantly, deployment. However it didn\u2019t take us the full distance.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we provide a brief background on honeypots, discuss the design of OpenCanary, delve into the challenges experienced and our plans for the project. Along the way, we\u2019ll demo the trivially installable OpenCanary, configure a few fake services and provide an outsider\u2019s view of developing in Python.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lXhypJUbxVM/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 2466, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/lXhypJUbxVM", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-10-01", "added": "2015-09-30T02:44:36.400", "updated": "2015-10-04T10:23:04.984"}, {"category": "PyCon ZA 2015", "language": "English", "slug": "opening", "speakers": ["Simon Cross"], "tags": ["Room 215"], "related_urls": [], "id": 3940, "state": 1, "title": "Opening", "summary": "", "description": "Opening Ceremony\r\n================\r\n\r\nA general welcome and an introduction to all the exciting things that will be happening at PyConZA 2015!", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lk1F6CAk8f0/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 668, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/lk1F6CAk8f0", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-10-01", "added": "2015-10-03T08:44:14.900", "updated": "2015-10-04T01:57:21.058"}, {"category": "PyCon ZA 2015", "language": "English", "slug": "pragmatic-python-for-social-change", "speakers": ["Greg Kempe"], "tags": ["Room 215"], "related_urls": [], "id": 3923, "state": 1, "title": "Pragmatic Python for Social Change", "summary": "", "description": "[Code for South Africa](http://code4sa.org) is a civic technology lab that uses Python and open data to promote informed decision making to drive social change.

This crops up in all stages of a data analysis:\r\n\r\n  * During data preparation, when performing group-wise ranking, standardisation, or normalisation.\r\n\r\n  * During modelling, when fitting separate models to each group.\r\n\r\n  * During communication, when creating summaries or visualisations for display or analysis.\r\n\r\nPython has many tools that make it easy to utilise this strategy when solving data science problems. These range from list and dictionary comprehensions in the language, the *map* and *reduce* functions and *itertools* and *functools* modules in the standard library to dedicated packages like *Pandas*, *PyToolz*, *Blaze* and *Dask*.\r\n\r\nExplicit recognition of the applicability of the pattern allows one to reuse standard components for the bookkeeping code that handles the splitting and combining of the independent pieces. This allows one to concentrate on the data analysis code that is unique to the problem at hand. Since implicit in the pattern is the independence of the pieces, its applicability immediately implies a strategy for parallelisation which allows one to easily scale one's solution from single core to out-of-core computation on multiple machines, often with only very few changes to the code required.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce the pattern and how to recognise it by presenting some common code blocks. We will then look at some of the tools available, in particular *Pandas* and *PyToolz*, demonstrate their use, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.
